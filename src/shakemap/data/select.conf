# The tectonic_regions section should include sub-sections for all of the
# regions that can be reported by STREC. Each subsection (except for
# 'subduction' should have the following elements:
#   horizontal_buffer - a buffer that extends into neighboring regions
#       across which the GMPEs are blended.
#   gmpe - A list of one or more GMPE sets found in gmpe_sets.conf.
#   min_depth - A list of one or more minimum depths corresponding to
#       the GMPEs listed under 'gmpe'.
#   max_depth - A list of one or more maximum depths corresponding to
#       the GMPEs listed under 'gmpe'.
#   vertical_buffer - if the GMPE selection is depth dependent, (i.e.,
#       ther is more than one GMPE set configured under 'gmpe') this
#       buffer determines the width of the zone over which one GMPE set
#       is blended into the next.
#   ipe - An intensity prediction module; must be found in the 
#       collection of ipe_modules in modules.conf.
#   gmice - A ground motion to intensity module; must be found in the 
#       collection of gmice_modules in modules.conf.
#   ccf - A cross-correlation module; must be found in the collection of
#        ccf_modules in modules.conf.
#
# Min/max depth ranges should span all possible event depths.
#
# Subduction regions should be configured with three sub-sections: crustal,
# interface, and intraslab, each of which defines a 'gmpe' parameter with
# a GMPE set.
#
# Any parameters not specified for a region (i.e., the gmpe, ipe, gmice, or
# ccf) will be taken from the global model.conf.
