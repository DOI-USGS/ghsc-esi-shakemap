# This is the system transfer.conf file; it should reside in the user's 
# profile's INSTALL_DIR/config directory. The parameters here may
# be overridden by the event-specific transfer.conf found in the event's
# 'current' directory.
################################################################################

# There are three currently supported transfer methods:
# - pdl   Using the USGS Product Distribution Layer software.
# - email Sending earthquake results via email.
# - scp   Sending earthquake results to a remote system using SCP.
# All methods support multiple destinations (see [comcat] example under pdl,
# and [web_server] example under scp.
################################################################################

################################################################################
# To use the pdl transfer method, you must first install and configure pdl.
# Installation and configuration instructions may be found here:
# https://usgs.github.io/pdl/
################################################################################

# For each destination under PDL, you must configure the following parameters:
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - java: The path to java on your system, usually something like /usr/bin/java.
# - jarfile: The path to the PDL ProductClient.jar file on your system.
# - privatekey: The path to the PDL SSH private key file on your system.
# - configfile: The path to the PDL config file on your system.
# - devconfig: The path to the PDL config file to use when the -dev option is
#              invoked (default=None, i.e., the -dev option wil fail).
# A "properties" subsection for each destination should be added. It should
# contain zero or more "propname = value" pairs, where "propname" is a valid
# PDL property, and "value" is a string to associate with that property. The
# properties will appear on the PDL command line as:
#   "--property-propname=value"
# Multi-word properties should be joined by dashes (e.g. "this-is-a-prop").
# Values may contain spaces.
#
# A "cmdline_args" subsection MAY be added. This will contain any additional
# required PDL command line arguments. An example: For transferring data to
# the AWS cloud implementation of the PDL hubs, it is necessary to supply the
# command line argument: "--signatureVersion = v2".
# this would specified in the cmdline_args section as follows:
# ...
# [[[cmdline_args]]]
#   signatureVersion = v2     
# ...
#
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------      

# A sample PDL configuration is included below.  Modify the parameters described
# above with real values applicable to your system.

# [pdl]
#   [[comcat]]
#     java = [PATH_TO_JAVA]
#     jarfile = [PATH_TO_JARFILE]
#     privatekey = [PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY]
#     configfile = [PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE]
#     devconfig = [PATH_TO_DEV_CONFIG_FILE]
#     [[[properties]]]
#     [[[cmdline_args]]]

################################################################################
# To use the scp transfer method, you must first set up ssh remote login using
# an SSH private key. Instructions for doing this can be found here:
# https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/logging-in-with-an-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac/
################################################################################

# For each destination under scp, you must configure the following parameters:
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - remote_host: The network name of your remote server (i.e., myhost.mydomain.org)
# - remote_user (optional): user name on the remote server (default=same as local user)
# - remote_port (optional): port number on the remote server (default=22)
# - remote_directory: The directory on the remote server to which ShakeMap products
#                     should be copied. ShakeMap will append the event ID to this
#                     directory path, and place products in that new directory.
# - private_key: The path to the SSH private key file on your system.
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------      

# A sample scp configuration is included below.  Modify the parameters described
# above with real values applicable to your system.

# [scp]
#   [[web_server]]
#     remote_host = [REMOTE_HOST_NAME]
#     remote_directory = [REMOTE_DIRECTORY_PATH]
#     private_key = [PATH_TO_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY]


################################################################################
# We use transfer to send ShakeMap notifications via email.
# There are a number of "macros" that can be used in the subject line
# and message body. These macros They are:
#  - [MAG] Event magnitude.
#  - [LOC] Location string.
#  - [LAT] Event latitude.
#  - [LON] Event longitude.
#  - [DEP] Event depth.
#  - [DATETIME] Event date/time (i.e., 2018-01-18T11:34:25.123456)
#  - [DATE] Event date (i.e., "Jan 31, 2018")
#  - [TIME] Event time (i.e., "11:34:23")
#  - [EVENTID] Earthquake event ID.
#  - [NETID] Earthquake network ID.
################################################################################

# The email transfer module has one global parameter that applies to all
# destinations:
# - mail_once: True indicates that emails should only be generated once.
#              False indicates that emails should be sent for every version
#              of the event that is processed. Defaults to True.

# For each destination under email, you must configure the following parameters:
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - sender: The email address that will be the sender.
# - recipients: The list (comma separated) of email addresses which should
#                     receive email.
# - smtp_servers: The list (comma separated) of SMTP servers that should be used
#                 to send email. The first SMTP server will be used unless the
#                 connection or sending fails, in which case the rest of the
#                 servers will be tried.
# - subject: The desired subject line (see macros list above).
# - attachments: The list (comma separated) of product files that should be
#                attached to the email.
# - message: The desired message body (see macros list above). This may be
#            a multi-line message enclosed in triple quotes:
#            """<multi-line message"""
#            See example below.
# - cancel_subject: The subject line for cancellation messages (see macros
#                   list above).
# - cancel_content: The message body for cancellation messages (see macros
#                   list above). This may be a multi-line message enclosed
#                   in triple quotes:
#                   """<multi-line message"""
#                   See example below.
