# ShakeMap

This repository holds the latest version of the ShakeMap code.
ShakeMap is a system for rapidly characterizing the extent and distribution of
strong ground shaking following significant earthquakes. The code is 
primarily written in the Python programming language. 

To receive updates on ShakeMap please sign up at 
[Gov Delivery](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOIGS/signup/39355).
We also encourage requests, questions, and discussions through
the Github issues tab associated with this repository. You may contact
the developers at shakemap@usgs.gov. 

# Documentation

The "quick start" guide, including installation instructions, is included in the wiki:
 - https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/esi/shakemap/-/wikis/home

# Mirrors

The primary host for the development of this software is on a gitlab instance here:
 - https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/esi/shakemap

One drawback of the gitlab system is that it is more cumbersome for users to create an 
account and post issues than in github. If you would like to be able to participate on
issues in gitlab, please send us a request to register you as a user.

Alternatively, if you have a github account, you can immediately post issues to the 
mirrored of this repository on github here:
 - https://github.com/DOI-USGS/ghsc-esi-shakemap
