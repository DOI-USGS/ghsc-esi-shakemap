Data Processing
****************************

The **model** module is ShakeMap's primary data processing module. It
gathers data, performs quality control, and interpolates ground motions
to a grid or pre-selected set of points.

The interpolation is performed by treating the ground motions as a 
conditional
multivariate normal distribution (MVN). The MVN approach employed by 
ShakeMap is described in :ref:`Worden et al., 2018 <worden2018>`. The 
specifics of ShakeMap's implementation of this method are described below.

.. _subsec-ground-motion-prediction-4:

Ground-Motion Prediction
==========================

Ground Motion Models
--------------------

ShakeMap uses ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) to provide the
initial estimates of ground motions. The GMPEs are drawn from the set
of GMPEs implemented by the GEM OpenQuake project. The full list of
available GMPEs may be found
`here <https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/tree/master/openquake/hazardlib/gsim/>`_.

In addition to these individual GMPEs, ShakeMap allows for a weighted
combination of two or more GMPEs. GMPEs are configured in ShakeMap
as GMPE "sets" (see *gmpe_sets.conf* and *modules.conf* for 
information on the specification of GMPE sets; the GMPE set to use
is specified with the ``gmpe`` parameter of the ``model`` section of
*model.conf*) and are executed through its 
:class:`MultiGMPE <shakelib.multigmpe.MultiGMPE>` class.
The MultiGMPE class allows for smooth transitions between tectonic
environments, as well as consistency with the methodology of other
projects, such as the `USGS National Seismic Hazard Model
<https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/hazards/>`_.

Ground Motion Model Sets
------------------------

By default, ShakeMap comes with a few GMPE sets pre-configured, and we review a
few of the important ones here. One example is the "active_crustal_nshmp2014,"
which combines four NGA West2 GMPEs using equal weights. This is used by the
USGS National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM)
for shallow crustal earthquakes, and was not changed in the 2018 update. We
also include the 2014 NSHM set of GMPEs for stable continental regions
("stable_continental_nshmp2014_rlme"). However, this was updated in 2018 to
use the NGA East GMPE. This can be specified using the "stable_continental_ngae"
GMPE set. One limitation of the NGA East model is that it was not developed for
use with magnitudes less than 4. Our implementation includes an extension of their
model to smaller magnitudes that extrapolates the small-magnitude scaling of
ground motions. The slope of this adustment varies with period and distance,
as illustrated in :num:`Figure #nga-east-slope`.

   as a function of period and distance.


Uncertainty from Multiple Models
--------------------------------

The MultiGMPE module uses a list of GMPEs and their weights to 
produce a weighted mean at each location. If we treat the outputs of the
GMPEs as random variables, then we can define a variable :math:`X` as a 
column vector of :math:`n` random variables :math:`X_1,...,X_n`. If the
weights are given by :math:`w`, a column vector with elements
:math:`w_1,...,w_n`, then the weighted mean, :math:`\mu` is given by:

.. math::

   \mu = w^{T}X

The variance of this mean can then be expressed as:

.. math::

   \mathrm{Var}\left( w^{T}X \right) = w^{T}\Sigma w,

in which :math:`\Sigma` is the covariance matrix of :math:`X`. This
covariance matrix is derived from the stated standard deviations of
the GMPEs (which may be heteroscedastic), and the computed correlations
among the elements of :math:`X`, as follows. The GMPE-defined standard
deviations supply a vector :math:`\sigma` with elements 
:math:`\sigma_1,...,\sigma_n` corresponding to the elements of :math:`X`
above. The correlation matrix, :math:`P`, is computed from all of the 
values provided by each GMPE for a given execution of the MultiGMPE (if
fewer than ten elements are computed for a given execution, then a 
correlation matrix is approximated). The covariance matrix is then
given by:

.. math::

   \Sigma = \sigma\sigma^T * P

in which :math:`*` represents element-by-element multiplication. Since
the standard deviations provided by the various GMPEs may be 
heteroscedastic, the variance must be computed for each point in the
output. This variance calculation is applied to the within-event,
between-event, and total variance of the MultiGMPE. Because variances are
additive, the total is expected to be the sum of the within-event and
between-event variances.

:num:`Figure #gmpe-test-mean`
shows the mean ground motion field computed from a 50-50 weighting of
the :ref:`Abrahamson et al (2014) <abrahamson2014>` and the 
:ref:`Chiou and Youngs (2014) <chiou2014>` GMPEs. The
field smoothly decays with distance, as expected. The
standard deviation field (:num:`Figure #gmpe-test-sd`) shows a 
somewhat lower value near the source than at distance.
Upon inspection of the cross-section plots and scale, however,
we find that the variation is very small in amplitude. This
variation is due to the heteroscedastic nature of the GMPEs.

   :ref:`Abrahamson et al (2014) <abrahamson2014>` and the

If the requested IMT is PGV, and some of the selected GMPEs do not 
produce PGV, then those GMPEs are removed from the list and the list
is re-weighted with the remaining GMPEs in accordance with their 
original proportional weights. If none of the GMPEs in a set 
produce PGV, then MultiGMPE computs 1.0 s spectral acceleration and
uses the :ref:`Newmark and Hall (1982) <newmark1982>` equations to 
convert to PGV. 

The MultiGMPE class will also accept a second set of GMPEs and weights
to use beyond a specified distance. 

.. _subsec-site-amplification-4:

Site Corrections
--------------------

Near-surface conditions can have a substantial effect on ground motions. Ground motions 
at soft-soil sites, for instance, will typically be amplified relative to sites on bedrock. 
Because we wish to interpolate sparse data to a grid over which site characteristics may 
vary greatly, we compute our residuals and predicted ground motions using 
site amplification factors.

A third set of GMPEs may be supplied to the MultiGMPE class
if all of the GMPEs in the primary set do not support Vs30-based site
amplification. The GMPEs in this set will be used to compute the site
terms, which will then be applied to the results of the primary set.
Otherwise, the individual GMPEs will each apply site corrections to the
ground motions they provide to the mean. As Vs30 has become a near-ubiquitous
site amplification proxy parameter in current-genereation GMPEs, the latter
approach usually applies.

Site Characterization Map
-------------------------

In general, site amplifications are computed using a Vs30 grid supplied
by the operator (see the Vs30 parameters ``vs30file`` and ``vs30default``
in the ``data`` section of *model.conf* for configuration information.)
Each region wishing to implement ShakeMap should have a Vs30 map that covers the 
entire area they wish to map. 

Some ShakeMap operators have employed existing geotechnically- or geologically-based 
Vs30 maps, or have developed their own Vs30 map for the area covered by their 
ShakeMap system. For regions lacking such maps (including most of globe) operators often 
employ the approach of :ref:`Wald and Allen \(2007\) <wald2007>`, revised by :ref:`Allen and Wald, \(2009b\) <allen2009b>`, 
which provides estimates of Vs30 as a function of more readily available topographic 
slope data. Wald and Allen's slope-based Vs30-mapping proxy is employed by the Global 
ShakeMap (GSM) system. 

Recent developments by :ref:`Wald et al. \(2011d\) <wald2011a>` and
:ref:`Thompson et al. \(2012 <thompson2012>`; :ref:`2014 <thompson2014>`) provide a 
basis for refining Vs30 maps when Vs30 data constraints are abundant. Their method 
employs not only geologic units and topographic slope, but also explicitly constrains map 
values near Vs30 observations using kriging-with-a-trend to introduce the level of spatial 
variations seen in the Vs30 data (:ref:`Thompson et al., 2014 <thompson2014>`). 
An example of Vs30 for California using this approach is provided in
:num:`Figure #thompson-vs30`. Thompson et al. describe how 
differences among Vs30 base maps translate into variations in site amplification in 
ShakeMap. 
 
.. _thompson-vs30:

   This map combines geology, topographic slope, and constraints of map
   values near Vs30 observations using kriging-with-a-trend.  Inset shows
   Los Angeles region, with Los Angeles Basin indicating low Vs30 velocities. 

:ref:`Worden et al. \(2015\) <worden2015>` and 
:ref:`Heath et al. \(2020\) <heath2020>` further consolidate readily
available Vs30 map grids used for ShakeMaps at global regional seismic networks
with background derived from the topographic-based Vs30 proxy to develop a 
consistently scaled mosaic of `Vs30 maps for the globe
<https://github.com/usgs/earthquake-global_vs30>`_
with smooth transitions from tile to tile.


Generic Amplification Factors
-----------------------------

Shakemap does not currently support operator-supplied basin
depths. Some modern GMPEs use basin depths (typically "Z1.0" or "Z2.5")
as an additional site amplification term. These GMPEs typically also 
provide empirical correlation functions to convert from Vs30 to the 
desired depth parameter. Note that for some GMPE combinations, these
factors will be inconsistent with one another. Ultimately we hope to
include a facility for the operator to provide basin depth grids. In the
meantime, see the next paragraph on generic amplification factors.

After the calculation of the mean ground motions, the generic
amplification factors, if any, are applied. The generic amplification
factors are additive (in natural log space) factors that are intended
to accommodate basin or topographic amplifications. The user-supplied
grids should taper to zero at the edges, and are assumed to be zero 
everywhere outside of the supplied grid(s). See the module
:mod:`shakemap.utils.generic_amp` for more on the generic amplification
factors.

.. _subsec-gmice:

Ground Motion to Intensity Conversions
======================================

While ideally we would have cross-correlation functions available
between macroseismic intenstiy and other IMTs (see
:ref:`subsec-cross-correlation`), no such functions
are generally available at this time. In their absence, we make use
of ground motion to intensity conversion equations (GMICEs). This
situation results in a two-step process: the appropriate conversions
are made to and from intensity and the other IMTs, and then these 
converted IMTs are downweighted in the MVN interpolation (as 
described by :ref:`Worden et al., 2018 <worden2018>`.) The weighting
is derived from the uncertainty (standard deviation) of the conversion
(see :ref:`subsubsec-weighting-residuals`).

The application of a GMICE in this manner is somewhat limited, however,
in that GMICE are typically only defined for PGA and PGV, with some
extending to spectral acceleration at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 seconds. Again,
the availability of cross-correlation functions for a wide variety of
IMTs and spectral periods would be a preferable solution, and is a topic
in need of further research.

For the current implementation of ShakeMap, we derive MMI from the best
available IMT (PGV, PGA, SA(1.0), SA(0.3), and SA(3.0), in order of
preference) for the MMI map. Similarly, we convert MMI to other IMTs,
and use the best available of those for the IMT map in question (as
discussed in :ref:`subsubsec-imt-selection`).

The available GMICE are specified in the modules.conf configuration file,
and configured with the ``gmice`` parameter in the ``modeling`` section
of *model.conf*.

Intensity Prediction Equations
==============================

A small number of intensity prediction equations (IPEs) are currently
available. The available IPEs are for active tectonic and stable 
tectonic regions. If a suitable IPE is not available, the operator may
specify the :class:`VirtualIPE <shakelib.virtualipe.VirtualIPE>` as the 
IPE of choice. The VirtualIPE uses the configured GMPE and GMICE to form
a composite IPE. That is, ground motions (typically PGV or PGV and PGA)
are predicted via the GMPE and then converted to intensity via the GMICE. 

While the VirtualIPE allows the application of ShakeMap to a wider range
of tectonic environments than the available IPEs, it comes at the cost of
greater uncertainty in the predicted intensity values than the available
IPEs. In particular, the standard deviation of a predicted intensity as 
given by the rules of error propagation (see :ref:`Ku (1966) <ku1966>` is:

.. math::

    \sigma_{\text{MMI}} = \sqrt{\left(\sigma_{\ln(Y)} 
        \frac{\delta \text{MMI}}{\delta \ln(Y)}\right)^2 + 
        \sigma^2_{\text{MMI}|\ln(Y)}},

where 
:math:`\sigma_{\ln(Y)}` 
is the standard deviation of the natural log of the ground motion as 
given by the GMPE,
:math:`\frac{\delta \text{MMI}}{\delta \ln(Y)}`
is the derivative of the GMICE at the value of 
:math:`\ln(Y)` from the GMPE, and
:math:`\sigma_{\text{MMI}|\ln(Y)}` 
is the standard deviation of the ground motion to MMI conversion as given 
by the GMICE.

Because many GMICEs are bilinear (see, for example, 
:num:`Figure #wgrw12-pgv-mmi`), the predicted intensities
and their standard deviations can contain some features that are 
less than ideal. For instance, :num:`Figure #gmice-test-mean` shows
the mean intensity from a VirtualIPE of the 
:ref:`Abrahamson et al (2014) <abrahamson2014>` and the 
:ref:`Chiou and Youngs (2014) <chiou2014>` GMPEs combined with the
GMICE of :ref:`Worden et al. (2012) <worden2012>`. The MMI values 
display a distinct change in slope as the relation reaches the
lower intensities. This change in slope is due to the different slopes
of the two lines of the bilinear relationship. More significantly, 
:num:`Figure #gmice-test-sd`
displays a dramatic drop in the standard deviation at the 
point where the two lines of the bi-linear relationship meet.
Neither of these features is likely physical, but are a 
consequence of the bilinear form of the GMICE.

.. _subsec-cross-correlation:

Cross-correlation Functions
===========================

There is, as yet, a very limited number of cross-correlation functions
in the literature.
Currently, ShakeMap depends primarily on the cross-correlation functions
defined by :ref:`Loth and Baker (2013) <loth2013>`. These functions 
provide spatial cross-correlations among spectral accelerations (SA) at 
various periods. ShakeMap, however, works with several IMTs in
addition to the SAs, and for which no 
cross-correlation models currently exist. Thus, we make several
approximations for the purpose of applying the Loth and Baker
relations to the non-SA IMTs:

- PGA is treated as 0.01 second SA.
- PGV is treated as 1.0 second SA.
- MMI is treated as 1.0 second SA.

Again, these approximations are made for the purpose of computing the
cross-correlations only. They do not affect other aspects of the 
treatment of these IMTs.

While not ideal, we feel that these approximations are reasonable.
PGA is typically the product of the high-frequency part of a 
seismogram's spectrum, and PGV tends to derive from a longer-period
portion of the signal, and is often associated with 1.0 second SA.
MMI, while its correlation structure is unknown, is closely
correlated with PGV.

As suitable cross-correlation functions become available
for additional IMTs, we will incorporate them into ShakeMap.


Data Handling and Outliers
==========================

As a general rule, ShakeMap assumes that by the time data reach 
**model** they have undergone fairly rigorous quality control. 
It is assumed that the seismic networks that produce the data
maintain checks and quality assurance protocols, and that the
ground-motion amplitudes ShakeMap receives can be assumed to
be valid. That said, it is inevitable that the occasional 
errant amplitude will make it through. ShakeMap's primary 
means of dealing with these amplitudes is through the flagging
of outliers.

Outlier flagging works through an operator-configurable 
parameter (``max_deviation`` in the ``outlier`` sub-section of
the ``data`` section of *model.conf*). Essentially, 
for each ground
motion in the input, a prediction is calculated with the
configured GMPE (or GMPE set). If the observed amplitude is greater than
``max_deviation`` standard deviations above or below the 
prediction, then that observation is flagged as an 
outlier and is not used in further processing.

Outlier flagging is suspended in cases where the magnitude
of the earthquake exceeds the operator-configurable value 
of ``max_mag`` (also in the ``outlier`` sub-section of the ``data``
section of *model.conf*), and no finite rupture model
is available. The thinking here is that for larger earthquakes,
the large size of the rupture makes it difficult to know 
the rupture distance, and the prediction becomes much less
reliable. While ShakeMap attempts to compensate for the
absence of a rupture model (see :ref:`sec-point-source`), 
it is still desirable to turn
off the outlier flagging at larger magnitudes. If a 
rupture model is available, the ``max_mag`` parameter has no
effect.

Outlier flagging is performed on a per-IMT basis. Thus, for
example, if a station's PGA value is flagged, the other IMTs
from that station are unaffected (unless they, too, are 
flagged). Derived parameters are, however, flagged if their source
parameter is flagged (e.g., if PGV is flagged, then the MMI derived
from it is also flagged).


Interpolation
=============

:ref:`Worden et al. (2018) <worden2018>` discusses the application of
the MVN to the interpolation of ground motions. Here, we
discuss some specific details of its implementation within ShakeMap.

.. _subsubsec-mvn-computation:

Computation
-----------

The conditional MVN can be summarized as a case in which we have a
random variable of interest :math:`\bm{Y}` where we wish to compute
predictions
at a set of *M* ordinates (:math:`\bm{Y}_1`) conditioned upon a set of
*N* observations (:math:`\bm{Y}_2`). We can treat these as a vector with
two components:

.. math::

    \mathbf{Y} = 
        \left\{
            \begin{array}{c}
                \mathbf{Y_1} \\ \hdashline[2pt/2pt]
                \mathbf{Y_2}
            \end{array}
        \right\},

with mean:

.. math::

    \bm{\mu_Y} = 
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{c}
            \bm{\mu}_{\mathbf{Y_1}} \\ \hdashline[2pt/2pt]
            \bm{\mu}_{\mathbf{Y_2}}
        \end{array}
    \right\},

and covariance:

.. math::

    \bm{\Sigma_Y} = 
        \left[
            \begin{array}{ c;{2pt/2pt}c }
                \underset{M\times M}{\mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_1Y_1}}} & 
                \underset{M\times N}{\mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_1Y_2}}} \\ 
                \hdashline[2pt/2pt]
                \underset{N\times M}{\mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_2Y_1}}} & 
                \underset{N\times N}{\mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_2Y_2}}}
            \end{array}
        \right].

where :math:`M \times M`, :math:`M \times N`, :math:`N \times M`, and 
:math:`N \times N` give the dimensions of the partitioned matrices. The
mean values may be taken from a GMPE or other ground motion model. The
elements of the covariance matrix are given by:

.. math::

    \Sigma_{{Y_i},{Y_j}} = \rho_{{Y_i},{Y_j}}\phi_{Y_i}\phi_{Y_j},

where
:math:`\Sigma_{{Y_i},{Y_j}}` is the element of the covariance matrix at
position *(i, j)*,
:math:`\rho_{{Y_i},{Y_j}}` is the correlation between the elements
:math:`Y_i` and :math:`Y_j` of the vector :math:`\bm{Y}`, and
:math:`\phi_{Y_i}` and :math:`\phi_{Y_j}` are the within-event standard
deviations of the elements :math:`Y_i` and :math:`Y_j`. We note that the
correlation between :math:`Y_i` and :math:`Y_j` may be a function of
distance: either physical separation, spectral separation, or both.

Given a set of observations :math:`\mathbf{Y_2} = \mathbf{y_2}`, and
their (usually predicted) means :math:`\bm{\mu}_{\mathbf{Y_2}}`, we define 
a vector of residuals

.. math::

    \bm{\zeta} = 
        \mathbf{y}_2 - \bm{\mu}_{\mathbf{Y_2}}.

The distribution of :math:`\mathbf{Y_1}`, given that 
:math:`\mathbf{Y_2} = \mathbf{y_2}`, is multivariate normal with mean 

.. math::
   :label: cond-mean

    \bm{\mu}_{\mathbf{Y_1}|\mathbf{y_2}} = 
        \bm{\mu}_{\mathbf{Y_1}} + 
            \mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_1Y_2}}
            \mathbf{\Sigma^{-1}_{Y_2Y_2}}\bm{\zeta}\text{,} 

and covariance

.. math::
   :label: cond-covariance

    \bm{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{Y_1Y_1}|\mathbf{y_2}} = 
        \mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_1Y_1}} - 
            \mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_1Y_2}}
            \mathbf{\Sigma^{-1}_{Y_2Y_2}}
            \mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_2Y_1}}.

The constituents of :math:`\bm{Y_1}` may be a particular IMT at multiple 
locations, multiple IMTs at a given location, or both: multiple IMTs at
multiple locations. In a ShakeMap, we may have an output grid of Q 
locations and wish to compute this output grid for P different IMTs. 
Thus, :math:`M = P \times Q`. Similarly, the N constituents of
:math:`\bm{Y_2}` consist of a number of IMTs at each of a number of
observation locations. Thus, as long as the elements of the covariance
matrix :math:`\bm{\Sigma_Y}` can be computed, Equations :eq:`cond-mean` 
and :eq:`cond-covariance` could be computed just once to provide the 
complete grids for all of the output IMTs. In most cases, however,
this approach is impractical and inefficient.

We note that in Equation :eq:`cond-mean` there is no interdependence
on the computed elements of :math:`\bm{\mu}_{\mathbf{Y_1}|\mathbf{y_2}}`.
That is, the vector of output ordinates :math:`\bm{Y_1}` may be 
divided in any 
convenient way, the elements of  
:math:`\bm{\mu_Y}` and :math:`\bm{\Sigma_Y}` adjusted accordingly,
and the computations can proceed independently. The 
same cannot be said for Equation :eq:`cond-covariance`, where the full
matrices must be used in order to compute the full covariance matrix
:math:`\bm{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{Y_1Y_1}|\mathbf{y_2}}`.

For even a small Shake map of 200 by 300 grid points, the
matrix :math:`\mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_1Y_1}}` becomes 60,000 by 60,000
elements. In a typical ShakeMap run, at least 6 output IMTs are
computed, making this matrix 36 times larger. This large size makes
the computation of 
:math:`\bm{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{Y_1Y_1}|\mathbf{y_2}}` impractical for
most situations. For ShakeMap uses, however, we are only interested 
in the diagonal
elements of :math:`\bm{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{Y_1Y_1}|\mathbf{y_2}}`, 
that is, the variances of the conditional means. In this case, we
can modify Equation :eq:`cond-covariance` by making the following
definitions:

.. math::

    \bm{\sigma_{Y_1}}^2 = \text{diag}\left(\mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_1Y_1}}\right),

(that is, :math:`\bm{\sigma_{Y_1}}^2` is a column vector formed from the
diagonal elements of :math:`\mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_1Y_1}}`) and

.. math::

    \mathbf{\Phi} = \mathbf{\Sigma_{Y_1Y_2}} \mathbf{\Sigma^{-1}_{Y_2Y_2}}
        \odot \mathbf{\Sigma^T_{Y_2Y_1}},

where :math:`\odot` represents the element-by-element product.

Then the conditional variances may be found by:

.. math::

    \bm{\sigma}_{\mathbf{Y_1}|\mathbf{y_2}}^2 = 
        \bm{\sigma_{Y_1}}^2 - \mathbf{\Phi}\bm{J}

where :math:`\bm{J}` is a column vector of ones.

As with the conditional mean, this formulation is insensitive to any 
particular partitioning of the :math:`\bm{Y_1}` vector. For ShakeMap
purposes, it is both convenient and computationally efficient to process 
each row of the output grid for each IMT separately.


.. _subsubsec-imt-selection:

IMT Selection
-------------

In a typical ShakeMap operational environment, it is common for each
seismic station to produce a number of IMT observations, some of 
which may be flagged as outliers. In addition, in ShakeMap V4, the
output IMTs may or may not correspond to any of the input IMTs. The
MVN approach described in :ref:`Worden et al. (2018) <worden2018>`
would allow all of the input IMTs to be used in the production of 
each output IMT. Such an approach, however, is inefficient.

If the output IMT is represented in the set of input IMT residuals, 
then any additional IMT residuals at that same site are mathematically
irrelevant. Since the computational effort of the MVN process increases
largely in proportion to the square of the number of residuals, adding
unnecessary residuals only slows the process, without adding additional
accuracy.

Similarly, we have found that in cases where the output IMT is not
represented in the set of IMT residuals at a station, then using the 
two IMTs that "bracket" the output IMT is sufficient to define the
observation point. For instance, if the output IMT is 2.0 second SA,
and 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 second SA are available in the input, then
using the 1.0 and 3.0 second residuals is sufficient. (In situations
where the output SA is higher (or lower) than the highest (or lowest)
SA in the input, we choose the single IMT at the highest (or lowest)
SA.)

:num:`Figure #cond-spectra-mean` illustrates this point. Conditional
mean spectra were computed for two sets of points. One set had SA
observations at three periods (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 seconds), and the other
set had observations at seven periods (0.02, 0.06, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 
and 9.0 seconds). The observations the two sets had in common (0.3, 
1.0, and 3.0 seconds) were constrained to be the same. The figure 
shows that in the shared regions (between 0.3 and 1.0 seconds, and
between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds), there is very little difference between
the conditional spectra. This point is reinforced by 
:num:`Figure #cond-spectra-sd`, which shows the standard deviations of
the two sets of conditional spectra. While the 7-point spectra is
better constrained overall, in the area of overlap (again, between 0.3
and 1.0 seconds, and between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds) there is virtually
no difference between the uncertainties. These figures were generated using the 
:ref:`Chiou and Youngs (2014) <chiou2014>` GMPE and the 
:ref:`Baker and Jayaram (2008) <baker2008>` spectral correlation function.
The odd kink in the mean plots at around 0.2 seconds is a result of the
specifics of the correlation function.

Event Bias
----------

Prior to computing the MVN as described in the section
:ref:`subsubsec-mvn-computation`
above, ShakeMap computes the event term (the "bias").
:ref:`Worden et al. (2018) <worden2018>` discusses the calculation
of the event term in more detail. 

The bias at site *m* for IMT *i* is given by:

.. math::

    \mu_{\delta B_{i,m}} = 
    \frac{\bm{Z}^T_i \mathbf{\Sigma^{-1}}_{\mathbf{Y_2Y_2},i} 
    \bm{\zeta}_i }
    {\tau_{i, m}^{-2} + \bm{Z}^T_i \mathbf{\Sigma^{-1}}_{\mathbf{Y_2 Y_2},i}
    \bm{Z}_i},

where
:math:`\bm{\zeta}_i`
are the total residuals of IMT i (or its closest surrogates, as discussed
in the section :ref:`subsubsec-imt-selection`, above),
:math:`\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{Y_2Y_2},i}`
is the covariance matrix of the within-event standard deviations of
that particualr set of residuals,
:math:`\tau_{i, m}`
is the between-event standard deviation of IMT *i* at site *m*, and
:math:`\bm{Z}_i`
is the correlation between IMT *i* and the IMTs comprising the rows
of :math:`\bm{\zeta}_i` multiplied by the "omega factors",
:math:`\bm{\omega}`,
of the residuals [for a discussion, see 
:ref:`Worden et al. (2018) <worden2018>`].

The variance of the bias terms is given by:

.. math::
   :label: bias-sigma

    \sigma^2_{\delta B_{i,m}} = 
    \frac{1}
    {\tau_{i, m}^{-2} + \bm{Z}^T_i \mathbf{\Sigma^{-1}}_{\mathbf{Y_2 Y_2},i}
    \bm{Z}_i}.

Unlike the bias calculated by earlier versions of ShakeMap, this approach
in non-iterative and does not seek to directly minimize the misfit of the
residuals. The approach described here apportions to the event term the 
fraction of the residuals that can be mathematically justified based on the
size and number of residuals. Thus, we
can compute a bias term (albeit a small one) even in situations where there
is only one residual. :num:`Figure #event-term-number-obs`
illustrates this effect using a uniform set
of residuals. The event term only approaches the mean of the residuals as
the number of observations becomes large. 

.. _event-term-number-obs:

.. figure:: _static/event_term_number_obs.*
   :width: 450
   :align: left

   The event term as a function of the number of residuals. Here all
   of the residuals have a uniform value of 1.0. The within-event
   and between-event standard deviations are 0.7 and 0.3, respectively.
   The blue dots indicate the event term computed given a particular
   number of residuals, and the black bars indicate the uncertainty
   of the event term (i.e., +/- one standard deviation). As the number
   of observations increases, the event term approaches the mean of 
   the residuals, and the standard deviation decreases.

In the ShakeMap implementation, the residuals used to compute the bias 
are limited to a subset within a distance of ``max_range`` km from the 
source (``max_range`` is found in the ``bias`` sub-section of the 
``modeling`` section of *model.conf*). As with the outlier flagging, the 
operator may
also set a ``max_mag`` for the bias (also found in the ``bias``
sub-section of *model.conf*). If an earthquake exceeds ``max_mag``,
and no rupture model is available, the bias computations will be
skipped.

The calculation and application of the bias may be turned off by 
setting the parameter ``do_bias`` (found in the ``bias`` sub-section
of the ``modeling`` section of *model.conf*) to ``False``.


Updating the Within-Event Standard Deviation
--------------------------------------------

Once the bias calculation has been performed, the residuals may be 
computed from the biased estimates of the ground motions. Similarly,
the adjusted within-event standard deviation of the residuals may be 
calculated:

.. math::

    \hat{\phi}_{i,m} = \sqrt{\phi^2_{i,m} + \sigma^2_{\delta B_{i,m}}}

where
:math:`\hat{\phi}_{i,m}` is the adjusted within-event standard deviation
of IMT *i* at site *m*,
:math:`\phi_{i,m}` is the within-event standard deviation of IMT *i*
at site *m*, and
:math:`\sigma_{\delta B_{i,m}}` is the standard deviation of the bias
as calculated by Equation :eq:`bias-sigma`.

With the adjusted within-event residuals, the elements of the covariance 
matrix are given by:

.. math::

    \Sigma_{{Y_i},{Y_j}} = \rho_{{Y_i},{Y_j}}\hat{\phi}_{Y_i}\hat{\phi}_{Y_j},

where the variables are defined as they were in the section
:ref:`subsubsec-mvn-computation`, but with 
:math:`\hat{\phi}` replacing :math:`\phi`.

.. _subsubsec-weighting-residuals:

Weighting of Residuals
----------------------

As discussed in :ref:`Worden et al. (2018) <worden2018>` uncertain data
can be accommodated in the MVN structure through the use of the "omega
factors". In our implementation, these factors are based on the adjusted
within-event standard deviation computed for each residual:

.. math::

    \omega_{i,m} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\phi}^2_{i,m}}
                              {\hat{\phi}^2_{i,m} + \sigma^2_{\epsilon,i,m}}}

where 
:math:`\sigma_{\epsilon,i,m}` is the additional standard deviation of the
observation of IMT *i* at site *m*. These factors are then applied to the 
covariance matrix and the residuals, as discussed in Worden et al.
Analogous factors, using the unadjusted within-event standard deviation 
(:math:`\phi_{i,m}`) rather than the adjusted standard deviation
(:math:`\hat{\phi}_{i,m}`) are used to modify the :math:`\bm{Z}_i`
vectors and residuals when computing the bias.

The additional standard deviation of a residual (i.e., 
:math:`\sigma_{\epsilon,i,m}`) can come from a number of 
sources. Observations converted from one IMT to another (via, for example,
the GMICE) will carry the additional uncertainty of the conversion process.
Intensity observations themselves -- such as those obtained through the
"Did You Feel It?" system -- have an inherent uncertainty due to the 
averaging process in their derivation. 
This standard deviation may be specified by the 
operator in the input file. If it is not specified, ShakeMap assigns a
default standard deviation to intensity measurements of 0.3 intensity
units. Other observations may have non-zero uncertainty for reasons of
instrument or site characteristics. This uncertainty may be specified
in the input file using the *ln_stddev* attribute of the amplitude tag.


Summary
-------

The interpolation process begins with the calculation of the bias, where
the covariance matrix, :math:`\bm{\Sigma_{Y_2,Y_2}}`, and the 
"omega factorrs", :math:`\bm{\omega}`, are assembled from
the unadjusted within-event standard deviations, and the
residuals, :math:`\bm{\zeta}`, are the total residuals computed from 
the unbiased estimates.

Once the bias values and the adjusted within-event standard deviations
are known, the covariance matrix and the "omega factors" can be 
re-computed (using the adjusted within-event standard deviations),
and the residuals are recomputed from the bias-adjusted estimates.
These updated factors (including the bias-adjusted estimates) are
then used in the MVN procedure as described in section
:ref:`subsubsec-mvn-computation`.


.. _sec-point-source:

Finite-rupture Approximations
=============================

In situations where no finite rupture model has been specified, 
ShakeMap will approximate distances (and adjust the uncertainties
of predicted ground motions)
using the point-source to finite-rupture equations developed
by :ref:`Thompson and Worden (2018) <thompson2018>`

Output: Points vs. Grids
========================

The typical application of ShakeMap is to compute ground motions 
over a gridded region. The grid is centered on the epicenter of 
the earthquake, and its extent is set automatically. The default
configuration tends to err on the side of larger maps, however
the operator may control the parameters used to determine the
map extent through the ``extent`` section of the *model.conf* 
configuration file. Alternately,
the operator may set fixed bounds for maps through the ``extent``
parameter in the ``bounds`` sub-section of the 
``extent`` section in *model.conf* (which, like all parameters in 
*model.conf* may be set globally or on an event-by-event basis).

ShakeMap can also be configured to compute ground motions for
an arbitrary set of points. The operator may create a file
containing rows of longitude, latitude, Vs30, and a location or facility
identifier (with the columns being separated by whitespace).
The file may then be specified with the ``file`` parameter in
the ``prediction_location`` sub-section of the ``interp`` section
of *model.conf*.


Performance Considerations
==========================

Multithreading
--------------

The run time of ShakeMap is most strongly controlled by the number
of input seismic stations (and macroseismic observations), the size
of the output grid, and the number of output IMTs. While the Numpy
code that does the majority of the computations is highly optimized
on most systems (including running on multiple cores), it may be
possible to improve the performance of ShakeMap on some systems
by setting the
``max_workers`` parameter in the ``system`` section of *model.conf*.
Setting ``max_workers`` to a value greater than one will tell 
ShakeMap to spin off separate threads for the output IMTs (thus,
there is no point in setting this value to anything larger than 
the number of output IMTs.) There is, however, an interaction with
the BLAS libraries underlying Numpy. If ShakeMap produces an 
error of the type::

    BLAS : Program is Terminated. Because you tried to allocate 
    too many memory regions.

then ``max_workers`` should be reduced (or, you can obtain or 
compile BLAS libraries that are reentrant-safe -- a topic which is
far beyond the scope of this manual.)

Grid Size
----------

At a given grid resolution (as specified in *model.conf*), the number
of points in the grid can grow very large for maps that cover several
degrees of latitude and longitude. ShakeMap's automatic scaling 
feature can often produce such large maps for larger-magnitude 
earthquakes. The resulting increase in ShakeMap run times can be
quite dramatic. To alleviate this situation in cases where ShakeMap 
is run automatically (and thus the map extent is determined automatically)
we have introduced the parameter ``nmax`` in the ``interp`` section of
*model.conf*. This parameter can be set to limit the number of points
in the grid
by increasing the X and Y grid spacing until the limit is not exceeded.
The default value of 500,000 seems to provide a good balance between
resolution and run time, but the operator may adjust the value to suit
their needs.
