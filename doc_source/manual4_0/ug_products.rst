Products and Formats
**************************
ShakeMap is fundamentally a geographic product, providing a spatial
representation of the potentially very complex shaking field associated
with an earthquake. Because of its complicated nature, we are required to
generate numerous maps that portray various aspects of the shaking that are
customized for specific uses or audiences.  For some uses, it is not the
maps themselves but the components that make up the ShakeMaps that are of
interest in order to re-create or customize the maps or
user-specific products. In this section, we further describe
these ShakeMap component products and the variety of maps and formats.

.. _subsec-comcat:

Accessing ShakeMap Products
===========================

For each earthquake, all maps and associated products for that event are
available via the “Downloads” link on each earthquake-specific ShakeMap
webpage. For more systematics uses of ShakeMap products, use the USGS
`Comprehensive Catalog (ComCat)
Earthquake database <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/>`_.

Interactive Searches for ShakeMap Products
------------------------------------------

Interactive searches for ShakeMap products is easily accomplished by
searching ComCat. Be sure to select “ShakeMap” as the “Product Type”
from the “Advanced Options” dropdown menu. One can set spatial, temporal,
magntidue and other thresholds for any search. In addition, one can
select ShakeMap intensity ranges using the “Impact” dropdown menu.
Also see section :ref:`sec_shakemap-archives-4`.


.. _subsec-getproduct:

Scripted, automated, or command line access ShakeMap products
-------------------------------------------------------------

Scripted or command line access to multiple events or specific product,
specific versions, sources, regions, time windows, etc., is best
accomplished by employing Python tools build with the NEIC’s 
`libcomcat <https://github.com/usgs/libcomcat>`_. In particular,
users are encouraged to use *getproduct*, which relies on libcomcat to
allow simple or complex queries for any ComCat products and formats.

For example, to download all of the versions of, say, the raster.zip
(or shapefiles) files by running this command on a Mac or Linux system::

  getproduct shakemap raster.zip -i us1000chhc --get-version all -o ~/tmp/taiwan/


Output Files and Products
==========================

The available ShakeMap products include (and each is described in more
detail in the sections that follow):

* **All-inclusive output file**
   * HDF file containing input parameters and data, output grids, and 
     metadata.

* **Metadata and runtime information**
   * JSON file of processing and constraints parameters, input data, 
     output paramaters, timestamps, and versioning.
   * GeoJSON station file containing seismic stations, DYFI observations, 
     predictions, converted parameters (e.g., MMI to PGM, or PGM to MMI).

* **Static maps and plots (images in PDF and JPEG formats)**
   * Macroseismic Intensity.
   * Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), Peak Ground Velocity (PGV), and 
     Pseudo-Spectral Acceleration (PSA) (when appropriate).

   * XML grid of ground motions
   * XML grid of ground-motion uncertainty

* **GIS files**
   * GIS Shapefiles in a zip archive (suitable for importing into
     `HAZUS-MH® <http://www.fema.gov/hazus/>`_).
   * `ESRI <http://www.esri.com>`_ Raster Grid Files in a zip archive.
   * `Google Earth <http://earth.google.com>`_ KMZ file containing various
     ground-motion layers, station information, and other parameters.

     contours have been smoothed.)


About the HDF5 File Format
==========================

HDF5 files are an efficient and flexible way to store large sets of
structured data.  HDF stands for Hierarchical Data Format and is an
open-source project. The data model consists of two types of objects:
groups and datasets. Groups may contain datasets or other groups
(along with associated metadata).  Datasets may contain
multidimensional arrays of data (along with accompanying
metadata). Groups may be thought of as directories or folders, and
datasets as files. The metadata associated with each object allows
HDF5 files to be self describing. Data is stored in compressed binary,
making the
files smaller and more efficient to read and write than text-based
formats (such as XML). For almost all uses a user will access the file
through an API (bindings are available for many languages), making the
details of file structure and layout not relevant.

For more information on HDF5 see the 
`HDF5 support page <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_.
The Python interface, h5py, is documented on the 
`h5py web site <http://www.h5py.org/>`_.

For ShakeMap, the two main data files (*shake_data.hdf* and 
*shake_result.hdf*) are accessed through the methods of the
shakelib classes **ShakeMapInputContainer** and **ShakeMapOutputContainer**.
For documentation see the `shakelib container module 
<https://usgs.github.io/shakelib/shakelib.utils.container.html>`_.

shake_data.hdf
--------------

*shake_data.hdf* is the input to the **model** module. It is built by 
bringing 
together the various ShakeMap configuration files (found in both the 
current profile's *install/config* path, and in the event's *current*
directory. It also aggregates information from the event's rupture file
(if one exists), *event.xml*, and the data files -- all found in the 
event's *current* directory. **shake_data.hdf** is usually created 
with the **assemble** module (and possibly modified by **augment**). 

It is generally not necessary for operators to access this file other
than through the interfaces of **assemble** and **augment**. For
developers, the file
is accessed through the shakelib `ShakeMapInputContainer interface
<https://usgs.github.io/shakemap/shakelib/shakelib.utils.containers.html>`_.

shake_result.hdf
----------------

The primary output product of the **model** module is the HDF5 file 
*shake_result.hdf*. There are some differences depending on whether 
**model** produces output grids or lists of points.  HDF5 files
consist of *Groups* or *DataSets*.  Groups can contain other groups
or datasets, and can contain a dictionary-like set of *attributes*.
Datasets consist of arrays holding data values, and
metadata in the form of attributes.  A very good introduction to
the HDF5 data format can be found
`here <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/HDF5Intro.pdf>`_.

*shake_result.hdf* consists of a number of groups and datasets. Our
implementation of HDF5 uses groups to contain Python dictionaries,
strings, and numpy arrays.  Dictionaries are stored as JSON strings.
For example, a Python *config* dictionary consisting of the following information:

.. code-block:: python

    d = {
        'name': 'config',
        'gmpe_set': {
            'Active_Crustal': 'Campbell2003'
        },
        'depth': 34.0,
    }

would be stored as a JSON string in a dataset called ``config``,
under a group called ``dictionaries``. In languages that support
JSON, these strings can be easily converted into a data
structure. Developers can access these properties using the
`ShakeMapInputContainer interface
<https://usgs.github.io/shakemap/shakelib/shakelib.utils.containers.html>`_.

*shake_result.hdf* contains the following metadata elements:

+--------------+------------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------+
| Name         | Location                     | Python Type | Contents                                   |
+==============+==============================+=============+============================================+
| config       | /dictionaries/config         | JSON string | ShakeMap configuration                     |
+--------------+------------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------+
| info.json    | /dictionaries/info.json      | JSON string | ShakeMap metadata                          |
+--------------+------------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------+
| stations_dict| /dictionaries/stations_dict  | JSON string | Dictionary representation of observed data |
+--------------+------------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------+
| rupture      | /dictionaries/rupture        | JSON string | Dictionary representation of fault rupture |
+--------------+------------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------+

It also will contain a number of arrays, which, when read with the HDFContainer getGrid() method, return
a Grid2D object which is a Python representation of a North-up 2D array of data, whose upper-left corner
coordinate and cell dimensions are known.  The definition of this object can be found `here
<https://github.com/usgs/MapIO/blob/master/mapio/grid2d.py>`_.

+-------------------+----------------------------+-------------+----------------------------------------------+


Each IMT dataset (MMI, PGA, etc.) is stored as a group containing two 
datasets: the mean values for each cell and the standard deviations.  
MMI data for the component 'Larger' will be stored under a group called 
``imts/MMI_GREATER_OF_TWO_HORIZONTAL``. The mean array will be stored as
``mean``, and the standard deviation array will be stored as
``std``.  All IMT grid datasets will be accompanied by a dictionary of
attributes:

+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Attr name | Contents                                             |
+===========+======================================================+
| units     | Physical units of IMT or standard deviation.         |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+
| digits    | Number of significant digits to use for the values.  |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+
| xmin      | The eastern boundary of the grid (degrees longitude) |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+
| xmax      | The eastern boundary of the grid (degrees longitude) |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ymin      | The southern boundary of the grid (degrees latitude) |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ymax      | The northern boundary of the grid (degrees latitude) |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+
| nx        | The number of grid points in the x dimension         |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+
| dy        | The grid interval in the y dimension                 |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+

Sampling of IMTs in the HDF file:

+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+---------------------+
| Name         | Location                                            | Python Type | Contents            |
+==============+=====================================================+=============+=============+=======+

+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+-------------+---------------------+

For datasets that are lists of points, the storage of IMTS is the same
as for grids, except that the data are stored as one-dimensional arrays.
Each IMT group wll also contains datasets ``lons``, ``lats``, 
and ``ids``, which provide the coordinates of the points in longitude
and latitude, and their IDs, respectively. For sets of points the metadata
attributes are:

+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Attr name    | Contents                                             |
+==============+======================================================+
| units        | Physical units of the IMT                            |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| digits       | Number of significant digits to use for the values   |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+

All *shake_result.hdf* files will have a group in the ``dictionaries``
group called ``file_data_type`` 
which will have a single attribute ``data_type`` that will be one of
'points' or 'grid'. This way the user can distinguish between the two
types of storage.

For grid files, there will also be sets of approximated attenuation
curves stored as one-dimensional arrays. These
will be labeled like ``/arrays/attenuation/<site>/<IMT>/<type>``
Where ``<IMT>`` will be one of the output IMTs (e.g., ``SA(3.0)``), 
``<site>`` will be one of ``rock`` or ``soil`` (for which ``rock``
means a Vs30 of 760 m/s, and ``soil`` means a Vs30 of 180 m/s), and
``<type>`` is one of ``mean`` (for the mean values) or ``std`` (for
the standard deviations). All units are in natural log space (except
for MMI). There will also be a set of datasets named like 
``/arrays/attenuation/distances/<type>`` which will contain the distances
(in km) corresponding to the points in the data arrays. The ``type`` will
be ``repi``, ``rhypo``, ``rjb``, ``rrup`` (for epicentral, hypocentral,
Joyner-Boore, and rupture distance, respectively). As with the other
distance arrays, ``rjb`` and ``rrup`` will be approximated if a finite
rupture model is not supplied in the input.

Dictionary datasets are stored as JSON strings.

There will typically be multiple *IMT* (Intensity Measure Type) datasets
(each containing the mean and standard deviation of the IMT). For instance
'PGA', 'PGV', 'MMI', and various 'SA(#num)' 
[where #num is the period as a floating point number; e.g., 
'SA(1.0)']. 

Python developers will likely want to access *shake_result.hdf* through
the ShakeMapOutputContainer class which may be found in the repository:
https://github.com/usgs/earthquake-impact-utils and imported from
``impactutils.utils.io.smcontainers``.
Also see, for example, the *contour* module [:meth:`shakemap.coremods.contour`]
for some basic access patterns.


Metadata and Runtime Information
================================


Supplemental Information
------------------------

The file *info.json* provides an aggregation
of important
earthquake-specific ShakeMap information and processing metadata.
This supplemental information provides a machine-readable (JSON)
rundown of many important ShakeMap processing parameters. It includes
information about the data and fault input files; the source mechanism; the
GMPEs, IPE, and GMICE selected; the type and source of the site amplifications;
the map boundaries; and important output information, including the bias and
maximum amplitude for each parameter. *info.json* is critical for
understanding or replicating any particular ShakeMap.

.. note:: Timestamps, versions of the ShakeMap software employed,
          event-specific parameters, and the version of the specific
          ShakeMap run are documented in the supplemental information
          provided in the *info.json* file.

.. _subsec-stationlist-geojson:

Stationlist GeoJSON
-------------------

The *stationlist.json* file is a GeoJSON file describing the seismic station
and macroseismic data that comprised the input to the ShakeMap. It is
contained within *shake_result.hdf* and may be extracted into the
*products* directory with the **stations** module. In addition to the input
station data, the file will contain predicted values and uncertainties for
the station location from the selected GMPE, as well as the computed bias.
The file also contains distance metrics, and amplitudes converted from PGM
to MMI or from MMI to PGM. 

To distinguish between seismic and macroseismic "stations", each station
feature has, within its **properties** section, and attribute
**station_type**. The possible values are **seismic** (for seismic
instruments) and **macroseismic** (for "Did You Feel It?" or other
macroseismic observations.

The file consists of a list of "features," each representing one seismic
station or macroseismic observation. A typical seismic station feature will
have a structure like this::

    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": "NC.J051",
      "geometry": {
        "coordinates": [

The following features should be noted:

- The **coordinates** are given in longitude, latitude order.
- The units of the observed and predicted IMTs are provided; typically
  percent-g for accelerations and cm/s for velocity. The units of standard
  deviation and bias are in natural log units.
- **ln_tau** is the logarithm of the between-even standard deviarion, **ln_phi**
  is the logarithm of the within-even standard deviation, and **ln_sigma**
  is the logarithm of the total standard deviation.
- Standard deviations for MMI are linear and omit the 'ln_' prefix.
- If the **flag** attribute is "0" or the empty string, the amplitude is 
  considered unflagged; any other value means the amplitude is flagged and
  therefore not included in the processing.
- The generic **distance** property is the same as **rrup** the rupture distance.
- The generic **intensity** property is the macroseismic intensity from the best
  available IMT.
- The **mmi_from_pgm** section contains the macroseismic intensity computed from
  the available IMTs (to the extent that the chosen GMICE is able to convert
  them).
- Floating point or integer values that cannot or were not determined will
  have the string value 'null'.

A typical macroseismic "station" feature will have the following structure::

The attributes of the macroseismic station are similar to those of the
seismic station (above), except:

- There will typically be only a single **channel** with a single **amplitude**
  element.
- The **pgm_from_mmi** section contains the output IMTs derived from MMI (to 
  the extent that the GMICE will make those conversions).
- Small intensity values (i.e., those less than 4.0) are not converted to
  PGM (i.e., they will have the value 'null').

The station list JSON file is rendered by the online web pages. See
:num:`Figure #napa-station-table` for an example.

Static Maps and Plots (Images)
==============================

ShakeMap generates a number of static ground-motion maps and plots for
various parameters (intensity measures, or IMs). Most of these maps are
available in JPEG format, as well as PDF files that---as vector-based
images---are suitable for scaling or editing. These maps are typically
generated automatically, limiting the format, extent, and features that can
be depicted. Nonetheless, these static maps are ShakeMap’s signature products
and serve as maps of record and for other purposes, as described below.
Static maps
can be accessed and selected using tabs along the top of the USGS earthquake
event page, as shown in the example in :num:`Figure #napa-event-page`.

   :align: left 

   Event page ShakeMap view for the 2014 M6.0 American Canyon (Napa Valley),
   CA earthquake. The static instrumental intensity map is shown. Tabs above
   the map allow access and comparison of different intensity measures
   (IMs), as well as the uncertainty map and station list.

Intensity Maps
--------------

Intensity images---typically of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI), but
potentially other intensity measures---are the most familiar ShakeMap
products. The main intensity map consists of a colored overlay of intensity
with the epicenter (and the causative fault, if supplied) prominently marked,
(usually) overlain upon the region’s topography, with other cultural and
geologic features (cities, roads, and active faults) plotted, depending on the
configuration of the ShakeMap system. A detailed scale of intensity is also
provided as described in detail in the :ref:`technical-guide-4`.

.. note:: **ShakeMap Symbology**. It is a recent ShakeMap convention to
          depict seismic stations as **triangles** and intensity
          observations as **circles** (for cities) or **squares** (for
          geocoded boxes). On intensity maps, symbols are unfilled so that
          the underlying intensity values are visible. On peak ground motion
          maps, observations are (optionally) color coded to their amplitude
          according to the legend shown below each map. The epicenter is
          indicated with a **star**, and for larger earthquakes, the surface
          projection of the causative fault is shown with **black lines**.
	  
Strong motion and intensity data symbols default to "see-through” (unfilled)
mode for the intensity map shown in :num:`Figure #napa-shakemap-mmi` and are
color-filled for peak ground motion maps (:num:`Figure #napa-pga`). ShakeMap
operators may chose to modify these defaults using alternative mapping
configurations.

   Intensity ShakeMap from the 2014 M6.0 American Canyon (Napa Valley), CA
   earthquake. Strong-motion data (triangles) and intensity data (circles)
   default to "see-through” mode for the intensity map. The north-south
   black line indicates the fault location, and the epicenter is a black star.
   The intensity color-coding either as observed (for macroseismic data) or
   as converted is derived from the conversion equations of
   :ref:`Worden et al. \(2012\) <worden2012>` as shown in the legend.

   as observed (for macroseismic data) or as converted by
   :ref:`Worden et al. \(2012\)  <worden2012>` as shown in the legend.
   The north-south black line indicates the fault location, which nucleated
   near the epicenter (black star). Note: Map Version Number reflects separate
   offline processing for this Manual.

Peak Ground Motion Maps
-----------------------

ShakeMap generates static maps for PGA, PGV, and
Intensity, and optionally, three separate maps for PSA
(commonly at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec). The PGM maps are distinct from the
intensity maps: shaking values on the former are colored image overlays; the
latter are PGM contours. On PGM maps, stations' fill colors
indicate the ground motion of the station converted to intensity.
The ground-motion values are converted to the intensity color scheme via the
selected ground-motion--intensity conversion equation (GMICE), and the
corresponding color scale bar is provided at the bottom of the map (see
example in :num:`Figure #napa-pga`). 

Interactive Maps
-----------------

Although the static ShakeMaps are useful, many of these products are more
suitably served as interactive maps which can be dynamically scaled (zoomed)
and layered upon with user-selected background and other overlays. The
layers are provided via GeoJSON, KML, GIS, Raster, and other formats. The
USGS Earthquake Program Web
pages employ `Leaflet <http://leafletjs.com/>`_, an open-source JavaScript
library that is suitable for mobile-friendly interactive maps (see, for
example, :num:`Figure #napa-contours`). Many of the
interactive features are geared towards balancing the experience for both
desktop and mobile visitors (:num:`Figure #napa-mobile`). Since
the interactive maps are zoomable, it is convenient to select
individual stations to query station
information and amplitudes (see the example in
:num:`Figure #napa-stationpopup`).
The interactive map also allows users to select and show/hide specific layers,
including seismic stations and DYFI geocoded intensity
stations (:num:`Figure #napa-dyfi`).

   :ref:`Wald et al. \(1999b\) <wald1999b>`.

The interactive maps may be accessed by clicking on the static ShakeMaps on
the USGS event pages (e.g.,
http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us10003zgz#impact_shakemap).
   
.. note:: Currently, interactive maps only portray contours of intensity.
          Other contours can be downloaded for users' programs, or overlain
          with the GIS or KML formats provided with each ShakeMap.


Regression (GMPE and Distance Attenuation) Plots
------------------------------------------------

ShakeMap regression plots are best visualized interactively online.
Each ShakeMap page has an “Analysis” tab that allows comparison of any
intensity measure against all data (both seismic and macroseismic) on
the map, and users can select the IM, residual views, log or linear
scales, different choices of distance measures (Rrup, hypocentral, Rjb),
and either rock or soil site conditions. See :num:`Figure #regression-plot`.

If the GMM prediction curve is missing, it is likely that the RSN
producing the ShakeMap is running an older version of ShakeMap than V4.0.

   of the ShakeMap page for an event.

ShakeMap also produces static graphs of the observational data
plotted with the biased and unbiased GMPE. For example,
:num:`Figure #northridge-mi-regr-w-dyfi` shows the 1994 M6.7 Northridge
earthquake MMI data, and :num:`Figure #northridge-pga-regr-w-dyfi` shows the
PGA data and GMPE.

Attenuation Curves
------------------

Also available for interactive plots (especiallly in combination with the
*stationlist.json* file is the file *attenuation_curves.json*. This file 
provides a set of GMPE values as a function of distance (and their 
standard deviations) for soft soil and for rock site conditions. The curves
are generated using the GMPE (or GMPE set) that is defined for the ShakeMap
run.Also available for interactive plots (especiallly in combination with the
*stationlist.json* file is the file *attenuation_curves.json*. This file 
provides a set of GMPE values as a function of distance (and their 
standard deviations) for soft soil and for rock site conditions. The curves
are generated using the GMPE (or GMPE set) that is defined for the ShakeMap

The structure of these files is::

  ::

  {
    "eventid": "<event_id>",
    "gmpe": {
      "soil": {
        "MMI": {
          "mean": [

    }
  }

The units of MMI are MMI, the units of accelerations and their standard
deviations are :math:`ln(g)`, and the units for velocity and its standard
deviation are :math:`ln(cm/s)`.

MMI Legend
----------

To aid with the production of interactive maps, ShakeMap produces a PNG
file (*mmi_legend.png*) of the intensity legend using the GMICE used
in the mapping. :num:`Figure #intensity-legend` is an example.

.. _intensity-legend:
.. figure:: _static/mmi_legend.png
   :width: 650px
   :align: left

   MMI legend PNG for use in mapping.


Pin Thumbnail
-------------

A thumbnail of a stylized ShakeMap MMI map is produced by the mapping 
process. This PNG file (*pin-thumbnail.png*) may be used as a placeholder,
entry point, part of an index, or as a visual identifier of
ShakeMap. :num:`Figure #example-pin-thumbnail` is an example.

.. _example-pin-thumbnail:

.. _sec_interpolated_grid_file-4:

Interpolated Ground Motion Grids
================================
     
As described in the :ref:`Technical Guide <technical-guide-4>`, the
fundamental output product of the ShakeMap processing system is a
finely-sampled grid (nominally 1km spacing) of latitude and longitude
pairs with associated amplitude values of shaking parameters at each point.
These amplitude values are derived by interpolation of a combination of the
recorded ground shaking observations and estimated amplitudes, with consideration
of site amplification at all interpolated points.  The resulting grid of
amplitude values provides the basis for generating color-coded intensity contour
maps, for further interpolation to infer shaking at selected locations, and for
generating GIS-formatted files for further analyses.

XML Grid
--------

The ShakeMap XML grid file is the basis for nearly all ShakeMap
products, as well as for computerized post-processing in systems such as
ShakeCast and PAGER [see :ref:`sec_related-systems-4`]. The XML grid is
available as both plain text (*grid.xml*) and compressed as a zip file
(*grid.xml.zip*). As XML, the grid is meant to be self-describing; however,
we describe the format here for the sake of completeness.

After the XML header, the first line is the *shakemap_grid* tag:

 ::

   <shakemap_grid xsi:schemaLocation="http://earthquake.usgs.gov
    http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/shakemap/xml/schemas/shakemap.xsd" 
    event_id="19940117123055" shakemap_id="19940117123055" shakemap_version="2" 
    code_version="3.5.1446" process_timestamp="2015-10-30T20:38:19Z" 
    shakemap_originator="us" map_status="RELEASED" shakemap_event_type="ACTUAL">
   
Aside from schema information, the *shakemap_grid* tag provides the following
attributes:


-  *event_id*: Typically this is a string of numbers and/or letters with or
   without a network ID prefix (e.g., “us100003ywp”), though in the case of
   major historic earthquakes, scenarios, or other special cases it may be
   a descriptive string (for example, we have previously used the 1994 
   Northridge earthquake as an example, and its event_id is “Northridge”).
-  *shakemap_id*: Currently the same as *event_id*, above.
-  *shakemap_version*: The version of this map, incremented each time a map
   is revised or reprocessed and transferred.
-  *code_version*: The version of the ShakeMap software used to make the map.
-  *process_timestamp*: The date and time the event was processed.
-  *shakemap_originator*: The network code of the center that produced the
    map.
-  *map_status*: Currently always the string “RELEASED”, but other strings
   may be used in the future.
-  *shakemap_event_type*: Either “ACTUAL” (for real earthquakes) or
   “SCENARIO” (for scenarios).

The next tag describes the earthquake source:

 ::

  <event event_id="Northridge" magnitude="6.7" depth="18" lat="34.213000" 
   lon="-118.535700" event_timestamp="1994-01-17T12:30:55GMT" event_network="ci" 
   event_description="Northridge" />

Most of the attributes are self-explanatory:


-  *event_id*: See above.
-  *magnitude*: The earthquake magnitude.
-  *depth*: The depth (in km) of the earthquake hypocenter.
-  *lat/lon*: The latitude and longitude of the earthquake epicenter.
-  *event_timestamp*: The date and time of the earthquake.
-  *event_network*: The authoritative seismic network in which the earthquake
   occurred.
-  *event_description*: A string containing the earthquake name or a
   location string (e.g., “13 km SW of Newhall, CA”).

Following the event tag is the grid_specification tag:

 ::

   <grid_specification lon_min="-119.785700" lat_min="33.379666" lon_max="-117.285700" 
    lat_max="35.046334" nominal_lon_spacing="0.008333" nominal_lat_spacing="0.008333" 
    nlon="301" nlat="201" />

The attributes are:

-  *lon_min/lon_max*: The boundaries of the grid in longitude.
-  *lat_min/lat_max*: The boundaries of the grid in latitude.
-  *nominal_lon_spacing*: The expected grid interval in longitude within the
   resolution of the numeric format of the output.
-  *nominal_lat_spacing*: The expected grid interval in latitude within the
   resolution of the numeric format of the output.
-  *nlon/nlat*:	The number of grid points in longitude and latitude. The
   grid data table will contain nlon times nlat rows.

Following the *grid_specification* tag will be a set of event-specific
uncertainty tags:

 ::

 <event_specific_uncertainty name="pga" value="0.466260" numsta="598" />
 <event_specific_uncertainty name="pgv" value="0.464209" numsta="595" />
 <event_specific_uncertainty name="mi" value="0.624327" numsta="598" />
 <event_specific_uncertainty name="psa03" value="0.436803" numsta="594" />
 <event_specific_uncertainty name="psa10" value="0.534212" numsta="595" />
 <event_specific_uncertainty name="psa30" value="0.577897" numsta="594" />

These tags provide the uncertainty for the ground motion parameters (natural
log units for all but intensity, which is in linear units) computed as a
misfit from the biased GMPE (IPE). This is equivalent to the intra-event
uncertainty. The number of stations contributing to each uncertainty is also
provided. If the number of stations falls below the minimum required to
compute the bias, the uncertainty value will be set to -1.

These lines are followed by a number of grid_field tags:

 ::

 <grid_field index="1" name="LON" units="dd" />
 <grid_field index="2" name="LAT" units="dd" />
 <grid_field index="3" name="PGA" units="pctg" />
 <grid_field index="4" name="PGV" units="cms" />
 <grid_field index="5" name="MMI" units="intensity" />
 <grid_field index="6" name="PSA03" units="pctg" />
 <grid_field index="7" name="PSA10" units="pctg" />
 <grid_field index="8" name="PSA30" units="pctg" />
 <grid_field index="9" name="STDPGA" units="ln(pctg)" />
 <grid_field index="10" name="URAT" units="" />
 <grid_field index="11" name="SVEL" units="ms" />

Each tag specifies a column in the grid table that follows.

- *index*:  The column number where the specified parameter may be found.
            The first column is column “1.”
- *name*:   Description of the parameter in the given column.
- *LON*:    Longitude of the grid location (the “site”).
- *LAT*:    Latitude of the site.
- *PGA*:    Peak ground acceleration at the site.
- *PGV*:    Peak ground velocity.
- *MMI*:    Seismic intensity.
- *PSA03*:  0.3 sec pseudo-spectral acceleration.
- *PSA10*:  1.0 sec pseudo-spectral acceleration.
- *PSA30*:  3.0 sec pseudo-spectral acceleration.
- *STDPGA*: The standard error of PGA at the site (in natural log units).
- *URAT*:   The uncertainty ratio. The ratio STDPGA to the nominal standard
            error of the GMPE at the site (no units).
- *SVEL*:   The 30-meter shear wave velocity (Vs30) at the site.

The measurement units:

- *dd*:   	Decimal degrees.
- *pctg*: 	Percent-g (i.e., nominal Earth gravity).
- *cms*: 	Centimeters per second.
- *intensity*: 	Generally Modified Mercalli Intensity, but potentially other
                intensity measures.
- *ms*: 	Meters per second.
- *ln(pctg)*:	Natural log of percent-g.
- *ln(cms)*:	Natural log of centimeters per second.

The number of *grid_field* tags will vary: smaller-magnitude earthquakes may
not have the pseudo-spectral acceleration values; scenarios will not have
STDPGA or URAT; and maps that have not been site corrected will not have SVEL.

The *grid_field* tags are followed by the *grid_data* tag, the gridded data,
and the closing tags:

 ::

  <grid_data>
  -119.7857 35.0463 4.3 4.21 5.26 5.76 5.76 1.09 0.5 1 800
  -119.7774 35.0463 4.34 4.23 5.27 5.8 5.78 1.1 0.5 1 800
  -119.7690 35.0463 4.37 4.25 5.27 5.84 5.81 1.1 0.5 1 800
  …
  </grid_data>
  </shakemap_grid>

The fast index for the coordinates is longitude, the slow index is latitude.
Dimensions are from upper left to lower right (i.e., from longitude
minimum/latitude maximum to longitude maximum/latitude minimum). The GMT program
*xyz2grd* (coupled with *gmtconvert*) is particularly useful for converting the
*grid.xml* data into a usable grid file.

Uncertainty Grid XML
--------------------

The file *uncertainty.xml.zip* is a zipped XML file
containing the standard errors for each of the ground-motion parameters at each
point in the output grid. It has the same structure as *grid.xml*, with the
additional *grid_field* names:

- *STDPGA*:	Standard error of peak ground acceleration.
- *STDPGV*:	Standard error of peak ground velocity.
- *STDMMI*:	Standard error of seismic intensity.
- *STDPSA03*:	Standard error of 0.3 sec pseudo-spectral acceleration.
- *STDPSA10*:	Standard error of 1.0 sec pseudo-spectral acceleration.
- *STDPSA30*:	Standard error of 3.0 sec pseudo-spectral acceleration.

The standard errors are given in natural log units, except for intensity (linear
units). The PSA entries will be available only if the PSA ground motion
parameters were mapped. No
ground motion data or Vs30 values are available in
*uncertainty.xml.zip*; for those, use *grid.xml.zip*.

	
GIS Products
============

ShakeMap GIS Files (zipped) are a collection of shapefiles of polygons of the
ShakeMap model outputs for each shaking metric: MMI, PGA, PGV, and PSA at 
several periods (usually 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec).  These file should be
easily importable into any GIS system. The ESRI Raster
Files (also zipped) are a collection of ESRI-formatted binary files.  It should
be relatively easy to convert these to (for example) ArcGIS grids using the
standard tools provided with the software.

Shapefiles
----------

The file base names in the shape files are abbreviations of the
type of ground-motion parameter:

  ========    ===========================================================
  *mi*        macroseismic intensity (usually, but not necessarily, mmi)
  *pga*       peak ground acceleration
  *pgv*       peak ground velocity
  *psa0p3*    0.3 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
  *psa1p0*    1.0 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
  *psa3p0*    3.0 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
  ========    ===========================================================

GIS shapefiles are comprised of seven standard associated GIS files:

  ==========  ===========================================================
  *.dbf*      database file with layer attributes
  *.shp*      the file with geographic coordinates
  *.shp.xml*  contains metadata in XML format
  *.shx*      an index file 
  *.prj*      contains projection information 
  *.lyr*      contains presentation properties
  *.cpg*      contains the character encoding scheme
  ==========  ===========================================================

In this application, the shape files are contour polygons of the peak
ground-motion amplitudes. These contour polygons are
actually equal-valued donut-like polygons that sample the contour map at fine
enough intervals to accurately represent the surface function. We generate the
shapefiles independent of a GIS using the Fiona Python package.
Contouring, as well as polygon formation and nesting, is performed by functions
written in the *C* programming language by Bruce Worden, and included in
the ShakeMap software distribution.

The contour intervals are 0.04g for PGA and the three
PSA parameters, and 2cm/s for PGV. The file also includes MMI
contour polygons in intervals of 0.2 intensity units.  These shapefiles have
the same units as the online ShakeMaps. The archive of files is
compressed in zip format and called *shape.zip*.  The *shape.zip* file is
available for all events, but the spectral values are generally only included
for earthquakes of magnitude 4.0 and larger.

ESRI Raster Files (*.flt* files)
--------------------------------

ESRI raster grids of the ground-motion
parameters and their uncertainties are also available.
The file base names are similar to those of the shape files, with the 
exception that 'mi' in the shape files is 'mmi' here.

  ========    ===========================================================
  *mmi*       macroseismic intensity (usually, but not necessarily, mmi)
  *pga*       peak ground acceleration
  *pgv*       peak ground velocity
  *psa0p3*    0.3 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
  *psa1p0*    1.0 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
  *psa3p0*    3.0 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
  ========    ===========================================================

The files are found in a
zipped archive called *raster.zip*. Each archive contains four files per
parameter: *<param>.flt* and *<param>.hdr*, which contain the median
ground-motion data and metadata, respectively, and *<param>_std.flt* and 
*<param>_std.hdr*, which contain the
uncertainties for the ground motions, and metadata, respectively. 
As with the other GIS files, PGA, PGV, and MMI are available for all events,
while the PSA parameters may only be included for earthquakes
M4.5 and larger.

The units (except for MMI, which is expressed in linear units) are the
natural logarithm of the physical units: for acceleration that is
:math:`ln(g)` and for velocity the units are :math:`ln(cm/s)`.

.. sidebar:: Loading ESRI Raster Grid ShakeMaps into ArcGIS

    1) Open the ArcToolbox in ArcMap
    2) Select Multidimension Tools -> Make NetCDF Raster Layer
    3) In the dialog that appears, select the input *.grd* file you
       downloaded and unzipped, and name the layer    appropriately ("vs30",
       etc.)
    4) The new layer should appear in your list of layers.
    5) Note: This layer is ephemeral---if you want to keep the raster
       version of the data, you'll have to save the layer to a file.

Google Earth Overlay
--------------------

The file *shakemap.kmz* enables the user to view the
ShakeMap in Google Earth (or other KML-compliant applications). A
color-scaled intensity overlay is provided along with a complete station list,
contours and polygons of intensity and peak ground motion, a fault representation (if
provided), epicenter indicator, intensity scale, and the USGS logo. The
transparency of the intensity overlay is adjustable by the user, as is the
appearance of seismic stations.

Note that the KMZ file is static and will not automatically update when we
update the ShakeMap
for an event, so periodic checks for updated maps and reloading of the KMZ is
recommended.

In addition to the ShakeMap-produced KMZ file, the USGS produces a KML file
(linked near the top of the page in the event-centric pages with the title
“Google Earth KML”) which contains not only ShakeMap data, but also data from
PAGER, DYFI, and other sources. This file should be the preferred
source, as it will have the most-up-to-date links, though it does not have all of
the layers available in the ShakeMap KMZ file.

Contour Files
-------------

ShakeMap also generates a set of GeoJSON contour files. These files are
named like *cont_<param>.json*, where "<param>" is replaced with one of 
the IMTs:

  ========    ===========================================================
  *mmi*       macroseismic intensity (usually, but not necessarily, mmi)
  *pga*       peak ground acceleration
  *pgv*       peak ground velocity
  *psa0p3*    0.3 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
  *psa1p0*    1.0 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
  *psa3p0*    3.0 s pseudo-spectral acceleration
  ========    ===========================================================

These contours are readable via a wide range of software, and are used in
the generation of the interactive web pages. The units for MMI are MMI, 
for acceleration they are %g (percent-g), and for velocity they are cm/s.

.. note:: The GeoJSON contours have been smoothed for usability reasons, and
          are therefore not suitable for detailed analytics or loss modeling.
          Users who require more precision are directed to the GIS shape
          files and ESRI raster grid files described eleswhere in this
          section.

Coverage Files
--------------

"Coverage" files suitable for the production of interactive maps and plots
are available in high-, medium-, and low-resolution versions. The files
follow the GeoJSON ".covjson" format described at `Overview of the 
CoverageJSON format <https://www.w3.org/TR/covjson-overview/>`_.

Real-Time Product Distribution, Automatic Access, and Feeds
===========================================================

ShakeMap products are distributed by a number of means immediately after they
are produced. The intent of these products is to help responders and
other responsible parties effectively manage their post-earthquake
activities, so we make it as easy as possible for users with a variety of
technological sophistication and infrastructure to access them. The general 
distribution methods are
interactive Web downloads, GeoJSON feeds, ShakeCast, the Product
Distribution Layer (PDL) client, and GIS web mapping services. 

Interactive Web Downloads
--------------------------

The easiest way to obtain ShakeMap products immediately following an earthquake
is from the `ShakeMap <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/>`_ or
`USGS Earthquake Program <https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes>`_
webpages. The event
page for any given earthquake has a download link where all of the products for
that event may be found. The ShakeMap page for an event also has a download link
that lists just the ShakeMap products. The variety
of formats for ShakeMap are described in the previous section.

GeoJSON Feeds
-------------

**Automatically Retrieving Earthquake Data and ShakeMap Files**. The USGS
Earthquake Program GeoJSON feed provides USGS ShakeMap, along with most other USGS
real-time earthquake products. `GeoJSON <http://geojson.org/>`_ is an extension
of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) standard and allows for a
variety of geospatial data structures.  There are JSON parsers in most modern
languages, including Python, Perl, Matlab, and R.

In order to automatically ingest the above data, use the automated 
`GeoJSON feeds <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php>`_. 
Mike Hearne (USGS), provides `an example python script
<https://gist.github.com/mhearne-usgs/6b040c0b423b7d03f4b9>`_ for querying the USGS
Magnitude 2.5+ thirty-day GeoJSON feed, and downloading the most recent version of
the event products desired by the user. In addition, the USGS Haz-Dev group provides
`other scripts <https://github.com/usgs/devcorner>`_ in various programming languages 
that allow access to the GeoJSON feeds. Modifications to these scripts allow
access to any ShakeMap (or other) products automatically, GIS flavors included.    

**Example**. *How can I use your API to get ShakeMap files download for
specific events (that shook Guatemala)?*
	     
The following GeoJSON summary query includes events between 2015-01-01
and 2016-01-01 in the bounding box lat. 10 to 20, long. -95 to -85,
in case an event outside Guatemala results in shaking inside
Guatemala; and includes a ShakeMap product:  

 ::

    http://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&
    starttime=2015-01-01T00:00:00&maxlatitude=20&minlatitude=10&maxlongitude=-85&
    minlongitude=-95&endtime=2016-01-01T00:00:00&producttype=shakemap

The results include an array of features with summary information for
each event.  The *detail* property is a URL for the GeoJSON detail
feed that includes URLs for ShakeMap files. For example, for the
*us100044xh* event, the GeoJSON detailed feed URL is:

 ::

    HTTP://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?eventid=us100044xh&format=geojson

The URLs for the ShakeMap files can be found inside the feed:

 ::
    
   FEED.properties.products.shakemap[0].contents['download/grid.xml.zip'].url
   FEED.properties.products.shakemap[0].contents['download/shape.zip'].url

In this case, these are the specific URLs are for the *grid.xml* file
and for the *shape.zip* files, respectively:  

 ::

   http://earthquake.usgs.gov/archive/product/shakemap/us100044xh/us/1450404175265/
   download/grid.xml.zip
   http://earthquake.usgs.gov/archive/product/shakemap/us100044xh/us/1450404175265/
    download/shape.zip


Additional Feeds
----------------

More information about USGS earthquake data feeds is available at our `Feeds & 
Notifications page <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/index.php>`_.

ShakeCast System
----------------

ShakeCast delivers user-specified ShakeMap products to the user’s
local or virtual system(s), and runs fragility-based damage (or
inspection priority) calculations for specific portfolios. More advanced
features of ShakeCast include a complete suite of damage
estimation and mapping tools, coupled with sophisticated tools to notify
responsible parties within an organization on a per-facility basis. See
:ref:`sec_related-systems-4` for more details. Complete background on ShakeCast
can be found on the ShakeCast `homepage
<http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/software/shakecast.php>`_ and the
documentation provided therein. 

Product Distribution Layer (PDL) Client
-----------------------------------

Finally, for academic and government users, ShakeMap products (and other
earthquake products) are communicated through the USGS’s `Product Distribution
Layer (PDL) <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/software/#PDL>`_.

Web Mapping (GIS) Services 
--------------------------

In addition to the downloadable GIS-formatted ShakeMaps (including shapefiles) that are
readily available for each ShakeMap event, USGS also hosts a real-time
`30-day Signficant Earthquake GIS ShakeMap Feed
<https://earthquake.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/eq/sm_ShakeMap30DaySignificant/MapServer>`_.
`ESRI <http://www.esri.com/>`_ provides a separate
`Disaster Response ArcGIS service
<https://www.esri.com/en-us/disaster-response/disasters/earthquakes>`_,
providing `live feeds
<https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=9e2f2b544c954fda9cd13b7f3e6eebce>`_
to several USGS post-earthquake products. 

.. sidebar:: Related GIS Service Interactions

   Users can access the ShakeMap data behind the GIS service in a variety of
   ways via the ArcGIS Server “REST API”. Some examples of commonly used
   data-access options are detailed below.

- `Export Map Image <http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/rest/apiref/export.html>`_: Download a static image of the map to include in their work.
- `Identify <http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/rest/apiref/identify.html>`_: Retrieve service data for given geographic location. (Point, Line, Polygon or Envelop)
- `Find <http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/rest/apiref/find.html>`_: Query service data that contains certain attributes. (ex. ShakeMap data for distinct event id)  
- `Query <http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/rest/apiref/query.html>`_: Query a specific layer in a service and return a detailed featureset. 

Along with the common GIS service interactions listed above, there are many
other calls that GIS developers can make through the `REST API
<http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/rest/apiref/>`_.

.. note:: **Earthquake Significance**. The NEIC associates a `*significance*
          <https://github.com/usgs/earthquake-event-ws/blob/master/src/lib/sql/fdsnws/getEventSummary.sql#L157>`_ 
          number with each earthquake event. Larger numbers indicate more
          significance. This value is determined by a number of factors,
          including magnitude, maximum MMI, felt reports, and estimated
          impact.  The significance number ranges from 0 to 1000.  The "30
          day significant earthquake feed" that determines which events are
          included in the ShakeMap GIS feed uses events with a significance
          of 600 and greater.  

**Accessing ShakeMap GIS Files:** While this GIS service only provides access to
significant earthquakes that have occurred within the last thirty days, users can
download GIS files for `significant events
<http://usgs.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=5555eabe9d65418d8e0b5677b3fe59b5>`_
on our website after the thirty-day period.  The significant earthquake archive has
a list of large events with links to each event’s webpage.  From the event
page, users can click on the ShakeMap tab and navigate to the “Downloads”
section to get a zipped bundle of shapefiles.

**Acknowledgement**: USGS appreciates guidance from the Esri Aggregated Live
Feed team, specifically Derrick Burke and Paul Dodd.  Their willingness to
share best practices for robust real-time sharing of GIS data enabled this
project to be completed.
