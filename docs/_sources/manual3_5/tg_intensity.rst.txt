Representing Macroseismic Intensity on Maps
*********************************************

:ref:`Wald et al. \(1999b\) <wald1999b>` relates recorded ground motions to Modified Mercalli Intensities in 
California. While not the first work of its type, Wald et al. had the advantage of using 
several earthquakes that were both very well surveyed for MMI, and also well 
instrumented for recorded ground motions. By relating the ground motions to MMI, Wald 
et al. made possible the rapid calculation of expected intensities from recorded ground 
motions. These “instrumental intensities” could be interpolated over an area and 
represented on a map.

As part of the original implementation of ShakeMap, :ref:`Wald, et al. \(1999a\) <wald1999a>` developed a 
color scale to represent expected intensities over the mapped area. This scale gives users 
an intuitive, easy-to-understand depiction of the ground shaking for a given earthquake. 
By mapping intensity to color, we also make the hardest-hit areas stand out for 
emergency responders and members of the media. Along with the color scale, we 
developed simplified two-word descriptions of the felt intensity as well as the likely 
damage. These abridged descriptions are not meant to replace
more comprehensive descriptions provided in the MMI (e.g.,
:ref:`Dewey et al., 2000 <dewey2000>`; :ref:`Dewey et al., 1995<dewey1995>`),
or EMS-98 (:ref:`Grunthal et al., 1998<grunthal1998>`) scales; however, they offer convenient description for 
our purposes. 

By relating recorded peak ground motions to Modified Mercalli Intensities, we can 
generate instrumental intensities within a few minutes of an earthquake. In the current 
ShakeMap system, these instrumental intensities can be combined with direct measures 
of intensity (from “Did You Feel It?”, for example) and interpolated across the affected area. With the 
color-coding and two-word text descriptors, we can adequately describe the associated 
perceived shaking and potential damage consistent with both human response and 
damage assessments of past earthquakes to characterize the shaking from just-occurred 
earthquakes.

Color Palette for the ShakeMap Instrumental Intensity Scale
============================================================

The color coding for the Instrumental Intensity map uses a standard rainbow palette (see Table 
1.1).  The "cool" to "hot" color scheme is familiar to most and is readily recognizable, 
as it is used as a standard in many fields (for example, see USA Today's daily temperature 
maps of the U.S.).  Note that we do not believe intensity II and III can be consistently 
distinguished from ground-motions alone, so they are grouped together, see :num:`Figure #figure1-16`. In 
addition, we saturate intensity X+ with dark red; observed ground motions alone are not 
sufficient to warrant any higher intensities, given that the available empirical relationships 
do not have any values of intensity greater than IX. In recent years, the USGS has limited 
observed MMIs to IX, reserving intensity X for possible future 
observations (see :ref:`Dewey et al., 1995 <dewey1995>`, for more details); the USGS no 
longer assigns intensity XI and XII. We note that there were only 
only two intensity-IX assignments for the 1994 Northridge earthquake (:ref:`Dewey et al., 1995 <dewey1995>`),
and only two or three proper intensity-IX assignments for the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (J. Dewey, 2015, personal communication).

We drape the color-coded Instrumental Intensity values over the topography to maximize 
the information available in terms of both geographic location and likely site conditions.  
Topography serves as a simple yet effective proxy for examining site and basin 
amplification, but we recognize that many users do not necessarily
benefit intuitively from having topography as a basemap.

ShakeMap Instrumental Intensity Scale Text Descriptions
========================================================

The estimated intensity map is usually wholly or partially derived from ground motions 
recorded by seismic instruments, and represents intensities that are likely to have been 
associated with the recorded ground motions. However, unlike conventional intensities, 
the instrumental intensities are not based on observations of the earthquake’s effects on 
people or structures. The terms "perceived shaking" and "potential damage" in the 
ShakeMap legend are chosen for this reason; these intensities were not observed, but they 
are consistent on average with intensities at these ranges of ground motions recorded in a 
number of past earthquakes (see, for example, :ref:`Wald et al., 1999b <wald1999b>`; :ref:`Worden et al., 2012 <worden2012>`). 
Two-word descriptions of both shaking and damage levels are provided to summarize the 
effects in an area; they were derived with careful consideration of the existing 
descriptions in the Modified Mercalli definitions (L. Dengler and J. Dewey, written 
communication, 1998, 2003). 

The ShakeMap qualitative descriptions of shaking are intended to be consistent with the way 
people perceive the shaking in earthquakes.  The descriptions for intensities up to VII are 
constrained by the work of :ref:`Dengler and Dewey \(1998\) <dengler1998>`, in which they compared results of 
telephone surveys with USGS MMI intensities for the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The 
ShakeMap descriptions up to intensity VII may be viewed as a rendering of Dengler and 
Dewey's Figure 7a.

The instrumental intensity map for the Northridge earthquake shares most of the notable 
features of the Modified Mercalli map prepared by the USGS (:ref:`Dewey et al., 1995 <dewey1995>`), 
including the relatively high intensities near Santa Monica and southeast of the epicenter 
near Sherman Oaks.  However, in general, the area of intensity IX on the instrumentally 
derived intensity map is slightly larger than on the USGS Modified Mercalli intensity 
map. This reflects the fact that although much of the Santa Susanna mountains, north and 
northwest of the epicenter, were very strongly shaken, the region is also sparsely 
populated, hence, observed intensities could not be determined there.  This is a fundamental 
difference between observed and instrumentally derived intensities: instrumental 
intensities will show high levels of strong shaking independent of the exposure of 
populations and buildings, while observed intensities only represent intensities where there are 
structures to damage and people to experience the earthquake.

The ShakeMap descriptions of felt shaking begin to lose meaning above intensity VII or VIII. In 
the :ref:`Dengler and Dewey \(1998\) <dengler1998>` study, peoples' perception of shaking began to saturate in 
the VII-VIII range, with more than half the people at VII-VIII and above 
reporting the shaking as "violent" (on a scale from "weak" to "violent”).  In the ShakeMap 
descriptions, we intensified the descriptions of shaking with increases of intensity above 
VII, because the evidence from instrumental data is that the shaking is stronger.  But we 
know of no solid evidence that one could discriminate intensities higher than VII on the 
basis of different individuals' descriptions of perceived shaking alone.

ShakeMap is not unique in describing intensity VI as corresponding to strong shaking. In 
the 7-point Japanese macroseismic scale, for which intensity 4 is equivalent to MMI VI, 
intensity 4 is described as "strong." In the European Macroseismic Scale (:ref:`Grunthel et al., 
1998 <grunthal1998>`) (EMS-98), which is compatible with MMI (:ref:`Musson et al., 2010 <musson2010>`), the bullet description of intensity 
V is  "strong."  Higher EMS-98 intensities are given bullet descriptions in terms of the 
damage they produce, rather than the strength of perceived shaking.

ShakeMap Intensity Scale and Peak Ground Motions
===================================================

The ShakeMap Instrumental Intensity Scale Legend provides the PGA and PGV
associated with the central value in each 
intensity box (see :num:`Figure #figure1-16`). For all current GMICEs, the ground motion scale is 
logarithmic, with an increase of one intensity unit resulting from approximately a 
doubling of peak ground motion. Nevertheless, each GMICE has its own mapping of 
ground motion to intensity, and thus the values shown in the scale legend can vary, 
depending on the GMICE chosen for the map in question. To avoid confusion, the 
legends now have a citation in the lower left specifying which GMICE was used to 
produce the map and scale. Note, however, that while the mapping of ground motion to 
intensity varies, the mapping of color to intensity remains the same for all maps. 

We note that the ShakeMap legends (e.g., :num:`Figure #figure1-16`) have evolved slightly from the 
earlier version of ShakeMap and the 2005 ShakeMap Manual. The PGMs tabulated are 
no longer provided by (previously redundant) PGM ranges, but rather by the median 
motions associated with the intensity on the scale. 

Color Coding Stations by Intensity
===================================

Traditionally, stations on the PGM ShakeMaps were color-coded to the seismic network
that provided them. More recent versions of ShakeMap, however, allow the operator to
color the stations with the intensity they produced, with each PGM parameter (e.g., PGA,
PGV, PSA03) using its own intensity correlation. :num:`Figure #figure1-11` (and 
many of the other figures throughout this guide) illustrates the color coding of stations
by their intensity values for several parameters. The operator can elect this option by 
calling the program *mapping* with the flag *-pgminten*.

   rectangle), strong motion data (triangles) and intensity data (circles). Stations and macroseismic 
   data are color coded according to their intensity value, either as observed (for macroseismic data) 
   or as converted by :ref:`Worden et al. \(2011\) <worden2011>` and indicated by the scales shown. Note: 
   Macroseismic data do not change colors from map to map, but seismic stations do, since the 
   estimated intensity conversion depends on which parameter is used.
