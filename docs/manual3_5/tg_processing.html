<p>As discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="users_guide.html#users-guide"><span class="std std-ref">User’s Guide</span></a>, ShakeMap produces a range of output products.
However, ShakeMap’s primary outputs are grids of interpolated ground motions, from
which the other grids, contours, and maps are derived. Interpolated grids are produced for
PGA, PGV, macroseismic intensity (we will hereafter refer to macroseismic intensity
as “MMI” for Modified Mercalli Intensity, but other intensity measures are supported),
and (optionally) pseudo-spectral accelerations at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec. Attendant grids of
shaking-parameter uncertainty and Vs30, are also produced as separate
products or for later analyses of each intermediate processing step, if so desired.</p>
<p>The ShakeMap program responsible for producing the interpolated grids is called
“<em>grind</em>”.  This section is a description of the way <em>grind</em> works, and some of the
configuration parameters and command-line flags that control specific functionality. (For
a complete description of configuring and running <em>grind</em>, see the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#sm35-software-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Software Guide</span></a> and the
configuration file <em>grind.conf</em>.)</p>

<p>The sections that follow provide a more complete description of the processing steps outlined
above.</p>
<div class="section" id="data-preparation">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.5.1. </span>Data preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-preparation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first step in processing is the preparation of the parametric data. As discussed in the
<a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#sm35-software-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Software Guide</span></a>, ground motion amplitudes are provided to ShakeMap in the form of
Extended Markup Language (XML) files. Note that we describe here the behavior of
<em>grind</em> with respect to the input XML file(s). The programs that produce the input XML
(be it <em>db2xml</em>, others, or the network operator’s custom codes) will have their own rules
as to what is included in the input.</p>
<p>In our presentation here, the term “station” refers to a single seismographic station
denoted with a station ID (i.e., a code or number). In current practice, station IDs often
consist of a network identifier concatenated (using a “.”) with the station ID (e.g.,
“CI.JVC” or “CE.50281”).</p>
<p>Each station may have one or more “channels,” each of which is denoted by an ID code
(often called a “seedchan”). The last character of the ID is assumed to be the orientation
of the instrument (east-west, north-south, vertical). ShakeMap only
uses the peak horizontal component. Thus, ShakeMap does not consider amplitudes with a “Z” as the
final character, though it does carry the vertical amplitude
values through to the output station files. Note that some
stations in some networks are given orientations of “1”, “2”, and “3” (rather than the more
standard “N”, “E”, and “Z”), where any of the components may be vertical. Because of the
non-standardized nature of these component labels, ShakeMap does not attempt to
discern their orientation and assumes that they are all horizontal. This can lead to inaccuracies—it becomes the network operator’s responsibility to ensure that the vertical channel
is either excluded or labeled with a “Z” before the data are presented to ShakeMap.
Similarly, many networks co-locate broadband instruments with strong-motion
instruments and produce PGMs for both. Again, it is the network operator’s responsibility
to select the instrument that best represents the data for the PGMs in question. Aside from
the station flagging discussed below, ShakeMap makes no attempt to discern which of a
set of components is superior, it will simply use the largest value it finds (i.e., if
ShakeMap sees channels “HNE” and “HHE” for the same station, it will simply use the
larger of the two PGMS without regard to the possibility that one may be off-scale or
below-noise).</p>
<p>Currently, ShakeMap is location-code agnostic. Because the current SNCL (Station,
Network, Channel, Location) specification defines the location code as a pure identifier
(i.e., it should have no meaning), it is impossible to anticipate all the ways it may be used.
Therefore, if a network-station combo has multiple instruments at multiple locations, the
data provider should identify each location as a distinct station for ShakeMap XML input
purposes (by, for example, including the location code as part of the station identifier,
N.S.L—e.g., ‘CI.JVC.01’). If the network uses the location codes in another manner, it is
up to the operator to generate a station/component data structure that ShakeMap will
handle correctly.</p>
<p>Finally, each channel may produce one or more amplitudes (e.g., PGA, PGV, pseudo-
spectral acceleration). Note that these amplitudes should always be supplied by the
network as positive values, regardless of the direction of the peak motion. The amplitudes
for all stations and channels are collected and reported, but only the peak horizontal
amplitude of each ground-motion parameter is used by ShakeMap.</p>
<p>The foregoing is not intended to be a complete description of the requirements for the
input data. Please see the relevant section of the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#sm35-software-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Software Guide</span></a>

<div class="section" id="flagged-stations">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.5.1.1. </span>Flagged Stations<a class="headerlink" href="#flagged-stations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the “flag” attribute of any amplitude in the input XML is non-null and non-zero, then
all components of that station are flagged as unusable. The reasoning here is that for a
given data stream, the typical network errors (telemetry glitch, incomplete data, off-scale
or below-noise data, etc.) will affect all of the parameters (as they are typically all
derived from the same data stream), and it is therefore impossible to determine the peak
horizontal component of any ground-motion parameter. This restriction is not without its
detractors, however, and we may revisit it at a future date.</p>
<p>MMI data are treated in much the same way; however, there is typically only one
“channel” and one parameter (i.e., intensity).</p>
<p>ShakeMap presents flagged stations as
open, unfilled triangles on maps and on regression plots. In contrast, unflagged stations
are color coded by network or, optionally, by their amplitudes via their converted intensity
value, as shown in <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-2">Figure  2</a>. Flagged stations are also indicated as such within tables
produced for ShakeMap webpage consumption, e.g., the <em>stations.xml</em> file.</p>

<p>Once the input data have been read and peak amplitudes assigned for each station (which
may be null if the data are flagged), intensities are derived from the peak
amplitudes and peak amplitudes are derived from the intensities using the GMICEs
configured (see the parameters ‘pgm2mi’ and ‘mi2pgm’ in <em>grind.conf</em>). Small values of
observed intensities (MMI &lt; III for PGA, and MMI &lt; IV for other parameters) are not
converted to PGM for inclusion in the PGM maps. Our testing indicated that including
these low intensities introduced a significant source of error in the interpolation, likely
due to the very wide range (and overlap) of ground motions that can produce MMIs lower than III or IV.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">2.5.1.3. </span>Site Corrections<a class="headerlink" href="#site-corrections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Near-surface conditions can have a substantial effect on ground motions. Ground motions
at soft-soil sites, for instance, will typically be amplified relative to sites on bedrock.
Because we wish to interpolate sparse data to a grid over which site characteristics may
vary greatly, we first remove the effects of near-surface amplification from our data,
perform the interpolation to a uniform grid at bedrock conditions, and then apply the site
amplifications to each point in the grid, based on each site’s characteristics.</p>
<p>A commonly used proxy used to account for site effects (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#borcherdt1994"><span class="std std-ref">Borcherdt, 1994</span></a>) is Vs30,
the time-averaged shear wave velocity to 30 meters depth. Vs30 is also a fundamental
explanatory variable for modern GMPEs (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#abrahamson2014"><span class="std std-ref">Abrahamson et al., 2014</span></a>).  Since the use
of GMPEs for ground motion estimation is fundamental to ShakeMap, we follow this
convention and use Vs30-based amplification terms to account for site amplification.
In <a class="reference internal" href="future_directions.html#future-directions"><span class="std std-ref">Future Directions</span></a>, we suggest alternative approaches that require additional
site information beyond Vs30.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">2.5.1.3.1. </span>Site Characterization Map<a class="headerlink" href="#site-characterization-map" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Each region wishing to implement ShakeMap should have a Vs30 map that covers the
entire area they wish to map.  Using the Jan. 17, 1994, M6.7 Northridge, California
earthquake ShakeMap as an example (<a class="pageref" href="#figure1-4">Figure  3</a>), we present,
in <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-5">Figure  4</a>, the Vs30 map used.
Until 2015, the California site-condition map was based on geologic base maps as
introduced by <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#wills2000"><span class="std std-ref">Wills et al. (2000)</span></a>, and modified by Howard Bundock and Linda Seekins
of the USGS at Menlo Park (H. Bundock, written comm., 2002). The Wills et
al. map extent is
that of the State boundary; however, ShakeMap requires a rectangular grid, so fixed
velocity regions were inserted to fill the grid areas representing the ocean and land
outside of California. Unique values were chosen to make it easy to replace those values
in the future. The southern boundary of the Wills et al. map coincides with the U.S.A./Mexico
border.  However, due to the abundant seismic activity in Imperial Valley and northern
Mexico, we have continued the trend of the Imperial Valley and Peninsular Ranges south
of the border by approximating the geology based on the topography; classification BC
was assigned to sites above 100m in elevation and CD was assigned to those below 100m.
This results in continuity of our site correction across the international border.</p>

<p>Other ShakeMap operators have employed existing geotechnically- or geologically-based
Vs30 maps, or have developed their own Vs30 map for the area covered by their
ShakeMap. For regions lacking such maps, including most of globe, operators often
employ the approach of <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#wald2007"><span class="std std-ref">Wald and Allen (2007)</span></a>, revised by <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#allen2009b"><span class="std std-ref">Allen and Wald, (2009b)</span></a>,
which provides estimates of Vs30 as a function of more readily available topographic
slope data. Wald and Allen’s slope-based Vs30-mapping proxy is employed by the Global
ShakeMap (GSM) system.</p>
<p>Recent developments by <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#wald2011a"><span class="std std-ref">Wald et al. (2011d)</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#thompson2012"><span class="std std-ref">Thompson et al. (2012</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#thompson2014"><span class="std std-ref">2014</span></a>) provide a
basis for refining Vs30 maps when Vs30 data constraints are abundant. Their method
employs not only geologic units and topographic slope, but also explicitly constrains map
values near Vs30 observations using kriging-with-a-trend to introduce the level of spatial
variations seen in the Vs30 data (<a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#thompson2014"><span class="std std-ref">Thompson et al., 2014</span></a>).  An example of Vs30 for

<div class="section" id="amplification-factors">
<h4><span class="section-number">2.5.1.3.2. </span>Amplification Factors<a class="headerlink" href="#amplification-factors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>ShakeMap provides two operator-selectable methods for determining the factors used to
amplify and de-amplify ground motions based on Vs30. The first is to apply the
frequency- and amplitude-dependent factors, such as those determined by
<a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#borcherdt1994"><span class="std std-ref">Borcherdt (1994)</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#seyhan2014"><span class="std std-ref">Seyhan and Stewart (2014)</span></a>.
By default, amplification of PGA employs Borcherdt’s short-period factors; PGV uses mid-period
factors; and PSA at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec uses the short-, mid-, and long-period factors,
respectively. The second method uses the site correction terms supplied with the user’s
chosen GMPE (if such terms are supplied for that GMPE). The differences between these
choices and their behavior with respect to other user-configurable parameters are
discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#software-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Software &amp; Implementation Guide</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="correct-data-to-rock">
<h4><span class="section-number">2.5.1.3.3. </span>Correct Data to “Rock”<a class="headerlink" href="#correct-data-to-rock" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If, as is usually the case, the operator has opted to apply site amplification (via the <em>-qtm</em>
option to <em>grind</em>), the ground-motion observations are corrected (de-amplified) to “rock”.
(The Vs30 of “rock” is specified with the parameter ‘smVs30default’ in <em>grind.conf</em>.) See
the section “Site Corrections” in the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#sm35-software-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Software Guide</span></a> for
a complete discussion of the way
site amplifications are handled and the options for doing so.</p>
<p>Note that Borcherdt-style corrections do not handle PGV directly, so PGV is converted to
1.0 sec PSA (using <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#newmark1982"><span class="std std-ref">Newmark and Hall, 1982)</span></a>, (de)amplified using the mid-period
Borcherdt terms, and then converted back to PGV. The Newmark and Hall conversion is
entirely linear and reversible, so while the conversion itself is an approximation, no bias
or uncertainty remains from the conversion following a “round trip” from site to bedrock
back to site.</p>
<p>Because there are no well-established site correction terms for MMI, when Borcherdt-
style corrections are specified, ShakeMap converts MMI to PGM, applies the
(de)amplification to PGM using the Borcherdt terms, then converts the PGMs back to
MMI.</p>
<p><a class="pageref" href="#figure1-7">Figure  6</a> and <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-8">Figure  7</a> show shaking estimates (for PGA and
MMI, respectively) before site correction (upper left) and after
(upper right). Without site correction, ground
motion attenuation is uniform as a function of hypocentral distance (in the absence of a
finite fault model as in panels A through C) and fault distance (as in D); with site correction,
the correlation of amplitudes with the Vs30 map (and also topography) are more
apparent. This distinction is important: often complexity in ShakeMap’s peak ground
motions and intensity patterns are driven by site terms, rather than variability due to
shaking observations.</p>

<p>As the final step in correcting the observations to “rock,” if basin amplification is

<span id="sec-event-bias"></span><h2><span class="section-number">2.5.2. </span>Event Bias<a class="headerlink" href="#event-bias" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ShakeMap uses ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) and, optionally, intensity prediction
equations (IPEs) to supplement sparse data in its interpolation and estimation of ground
motions. If sufficient data are available, we compute an event bias that effectively
removes the inter-event uncertainty from the selected GMPE (IPE). This approach has
been shown to greatly improve the quality of the ShakeMap ground motion estimates (for
details, see <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#worden2012"><span class="std std-ref">Worden et al., 2012</span></a>).</p>
<p>The bias-correction procedure is relatively straightforward: the magnitude of the
earthquake is adjusted so as to minimize the misfit between the observational data and
estimates at the observation points produced by the GMPE. If the user has chosen to use
the directivity correction (with the <em>-directivity</em> flag), directivity is applied to the
estimates.</p>
<p>In computing the total misfit, primary observations (i.e., ground-motion observations from
seismic stations or MMI observations from <em>Did You Feel It?</em> or field surveys) are weighted as
if they were GMPE
predictions, whereas converted observations (i.e., primary obsertations of one type converted to
another type, such as ground-motion observations converted to MMI) are down-weighted by treating
them as if they were GMPE predictions converted using the GMICE (i.e., primary observations are
given full weighting, whereas the converted observations are given a substantially lower
weight.) Once a bias has been obtained, we flag (as outliers) any data that exceed a user-
specified threshold (often three times the sigma of the GMPE at the obsertation point). The bias is then
recalculated and the flagging is repeated until no outliers are found. The flagged outliers
are then excluded from further processing (though the operator can choose to modify the
outlier criteria or impose their inclusion).</p>
<p>(There are a number of configuration parameters that affect the bias computation and the
flagging of outliers—see the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#sm35-software-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Software Guide</span></a> and <em>grind.conf</em>
for a complete discussion of these parameters.)</p>
<p>The bias-adjusted GMPE is then used to create estimates for the entire output grid.  If the user
has opted to include directivity effects, they are applied to these
estimates. See the <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-interpolation"><span class="std std-ref">Interpolation</span></a> section for the way the GMPE-based estimates are used.</p>
<p>The Northridge earthquake ShakeMap provides an excellent example of the effect
of bias correction. Overall, the ground motions for the Northridge earthquake exceed
average estimates of existing GMPEs—in other words, it has a significant positive
inter-event bias term (see <a class="pageref" href="#nr-pga-regr">Figure  8</a> and <a class="pageref" href="#nr-pgv-regr">Figure  9</a>,

<p>The interpolation procedure is described in detail in <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#worden2012"><span class="std std-ref">Worden et al. (2010)</span></a>. Here we
summarize it only briefly.</p>
<p>To compute an estimate of ground motion at a given point in the latitude-longitude grid,
ShakeMap finds an uncertainty-weighted average of 1) direct observations of ground
motion or intensity, 2) direct observations of one type converted to another type (i.e.,
PGM converted to MMI, or vice versa), and 3) estimates from a GMPE or IPE. Note that
because the output grid points are some distance from the observations, we use a spatial
correlation function to obtain an uncertainty for each observation when evaluated at the
outpoint point. The total uncertainty at each point is a function of the uncertainty of the
direct observations obtained with the distance-to-observation uncertainty derived from
the spatial correlation function, and that of the GMPE or IPE.</p>
<p>In the case of direct ground-motion observations, the uncertainty at the observation site is
assumed to be zero, whereas at the “site” of a direct intensity observation, it is assumed to
have a non-zero uncertainty due to the spatially averaged nature of intensity assignments.
The uncertainty for estimates from
GMPEs (and IPEs) is the stated uncertainty given in the generative publication or
document. The GMPE uncertainty is often spatially constant, but this is not always the
case, especially with more recent GMPEs.</p>
<p>For converted observations, a third uncertainty is combined with zero-distance
uncertainty and the uncertainty due to spatial separation: the uncertainty associated with
the conversion itself (i.e., the uncertainty of the GMICE). This additional uncertainty
results in the converted observations being down-weighted in the average, relative to the
primary observations.</p>
<p>Because a point in the output may be closer to or farther from the source than a nearby
contributing observation, the observation is scaled by the ratio of the GMPE (or IPE)
estimates at the output point and the observation point:</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.5.5. </span>Differences in Handling MMI<a class="headerlink" href="#differences-in-handling-mmi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The processing of MMI is designed to be identical to the processing of PGM; however, a
few differences remain:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>As of this writing, there are no spatial correlation functions available for MMI.
We are working on developing one, but it is not complete. We currently use the
spatial correlation function for PGA as a proxy for MMI, though this approach is
not optimal.</p></li>
<li><p>Because there are relatively few IPEs available at this time, we have introduced
the idea of a virtual IPE (VIPE). If the user does not specify an IPE in <em>grind.conf</em>,
<em>grind</em> will use the configured GMPE in combination with the GMICE to simulate
the functionality of an IPE. In particular, the bias is computed as a magnitude
adjustment to the VIPE to produce the best fit to the intensity observations (and
converted observations) as described in <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-event-bias"><span class="std std-ref">Event Bias</span></a>; and the
uncertainty of the VIPE is the combined uncertainty of the GMPE and the
GMICE.</p></li>
<li><p>As mentioned above, intensity observations are given an inherent uncertainty
because of the nature of their assignment. Our research has shown that this
uncertainty amounts to a few tenths of an intensity unit, but it varies with the
number of responses within the averaged area. Research in this area is incomplete,
and intensity data can contain both “Did You Feel It?” data and traditionally
assigned intensities. Because of these considerations, we currently use a
conservative value of 0.5 intensity units for the inherent uncertainty.</p></li>
<li><p>The directivity function we use (<a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#rowshandel2010"><span class="std std-ref">Rowshandel, 2010</span></a>) does not have terms for
intensity. This is not a problem when using the VIPE, since we can apply the
directivity function to the output of the encapsulated GMPE before converting to
intensity. But when a true IPE is used there is currently no explicit way to apply our
directivity function.  In these cases, we use the VIPE to
compute two intensity grids: one with and one without directivity applied. We
then subtract the former from the latter to produce a grid of directivity adjustment
factors. That grid is then added to the output of the
IPE. We use the same procedure when creating estimates at observation locations
for computing the bias.</p></li>
<li><p>As mentioned above, we currently have no function for applying basin
amplification to the intensity data. We hope to remedy this shortly with a solution
similar to item 4, above, where we apply the basin effects through a
VIPE. In practice, the main areas where basin depth models are
available are also those within which station density is great
(e.g., Los Angeles and San Francisco, California).</p></li>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.5.6. </span>Fault Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#fault-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Small-to-moderate earthquakes can be effectively characterized as a point source, with
distances being calculated from the hypocenter (or epicenter, depending on the GMPE).
But accurate prediction of ground motions from larger earthquakes requires knowledge of
the fault geometry. This is because ground motions attenuate with
distance from the source (i.e. fault), but for a spatially extended source, that distance can be quite different
from the distance to the hypocenter. Most GMPEs are developed using earthquakes with
well-constrained fault geometry, and therefore are not suitable for prediction of ground
motions from large earthquakes when only a point source is available. As discussed in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-median-distance"><span class="std std-ref">next section</span></a>, we handle this common situation by using terms that modify the
distance calculation to accommodate the unknown fault geometry. We also allow the
operator to specify a finite fault, as discussed in sections <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-fault-dimensions"><span class="std std-ref">Fault Dimensions</span></a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-directivity"><span class="std std-ref">Directivity</span></a>.</p>

<span id="sec-median-distance"></span><h3><span class="section-number">2.5.6.1. </span>Median Distance and Finite Faults<a class="headerlink" href="#median-distance-and-finite-faults" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#sm35-software-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Software Guide</span></a>, the user may specify a
finite fault to guide the
estimates of the GMPE, but often a fault model is not available for some time following
an earthquake. For larger events, this becomes problematic because the
distance-to-source
term ShakeMap provides to the GMPE in order to predict ground motions comes
from the hypocenter (or epicenter, depending on the GMPE) rather than the actual rupture
plane (or its surface projection), and for a large fault, these distances can be quite
different. For a non-point source, in fact, the hypocentral distance
can equal the closest distance, but it can also be significantly greater than the
closest distance.</p>
<p>ShakeMap addresses this issue by introducing the concept of median distance. Following
a study by <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#epri2003"><span class="std std-ref">EPRI (2003)</span></a>, we assume that an unknown fault of appropriate size could have
any orientation, and we use EPRI’s equations to compute the distance that produces
the median ground motions of
all the possible fault orientations that pass through the hypocenter. (Thus, the term
“median distance” is a bit of a misnomer; it is more literally “distance of median ground
motion.”) Thus, for each point for which we want ground motion estimates, we compute
this distance and use it as input to the GMPE. We also adjust the uncertainty of the
estimate to account for the larger uncertainty associated with this situation. This feature
automatically applies for earthquake magnitudes &gt;= 5, but may be disabled with the <em>grind</em> flag
<em>-nomedian</em>.</p>
<p>Ideally, GMPE developers would always regress not only for fault distance, but also for
hypocentral distance. If this were done routinely, we would be able to initially use
the hypocentral-distance regression coefficients and switch to fault-distance terms as the
fault geometry was established. The median-distance approximation described above
could then be discarded.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#bommer2012"><span class="std std-ref">Bommer and Akkar (2012)</span></a> have made the case for deriving both sets of coefficients:
“The most simple, consistent, efficient and elegant solution to this problem is for all
ground-motion prediction equations to be derived and presented in pairs of models, one
using the analysts’ preferred extended source metric … —and another using a point-
source metric, for which our preference would be hypocentral distance,
Rhyp”. Indeed, <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#akkar2014"><span class="std std-ref">Akkar et al. (2014)</span></a> provide such multiple coefficients
for their GMPEs for the Middle East and Europe. However, despite its utility, this
strategy has not been widely adopted among the requirements for modern GMPEs (e.g.,
<a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#powers2008"><span class="std std-ref">Powers et al., 2008</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#abrahamson2008"><span class="std std-ref">Abrahamson et al., 2008</span></a>;
<a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#abrahamson2014"><span class="std std-ref">2014</span></a>).</p>
<p>The hypocentral- or median-distance correction is not a trivial consideration. Note that for
Northridge, even when the fault is unknown and there are no data, the median-distance
correction (<a class="pageref" href="#figure1-7">Figure  6</a> and <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-8">Figure  7</a>, panels B and C)
brings the shaking estimates more in line
with those constrained by knowledge of the fault. As mentioned earlier, the shaking for
this event exhibits a positive inter-event bias term, so even with the fault location
constrained, estimates still tend to under-predict the actual recordings, on average.</p>
<p>While the effect of this correction for the Northridge earthquake example is noticeable,
for events with larger magnitudes, and thus larger rupture areas, the median-distance
correction is crucial before
constraints on rupture geometry are available (from finite-fault modeling, aftershock
distribution, observations of surface slip, etc.) For example, in the case of the 1994
Northridge earthquake, the dimensions of the rupture are constrained from analyses of
the earthquake source (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#wald1996"><span class="std std-ref">Wald et al., 1996</span></a>).</p>

<span id="sec-fault-dimensions"></span><h3><span class="section-number">2.5.6.2. </span>Fault Dimensions<a class="headerlink" href="#fault-dimensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#sm35-software-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Software Guide</span></a> describes the format for specifying a
fault. Essentially, ShakeMap
faults are one or more (connected or disconnected) planar quadrilaterals. The fault
geometry is used by ShakeMap to compute fault-to-site distances for the GMPE, IPE, and
GMICE, as well as to visualize the fault geometry in map view (for example, see red-line
rectangles in <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-7">Figure  6</a> and <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-8">Figure  7</a>). Examples of
fault-based distances include the distance to the surface projection of the
fault (for the so-called Joyner-Boore, or JB, distance), and the distance to the rupture plane.</p>
<p>While a finite fault is important for estimating the shaking from larger earthquakes, it is
typically not necessary to develop an extremely precise fault model, or to know the
rupture history that specifies the rupture propagation and slip distribution.
One or two fault planes usually suffice, except for very large or complex
surface-rupturing faults. In the immediate aftermath of a large earthquake, a first-order
fault model based on tectonic environment, known faults, aftershock distribution, and
empirical estimates based on the magnitude (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#wells1994"><span class="std std-ref">Wells and Coppersmith, 1994</span></a>) is often
sufficient to greatly improve the ShakeMap estimates in poorly instrumented areas. In
many cases, this amounts to an “educated guess”, and seismological expertise and
intuition are extremely helpful. Later refinements to the faulting geometry may or may
not fundamentally change the shaking pattern, depending on the density of near-source
observations. As we show in a later section, dense observations greatly diminish the
influence of the estimated ground motion at each grid point, obviating the need for precise
fault geometries in such estimates.</p>

<span id="sec-directivity"></span><h3><span class="section-number">2.5.6.3. </span>Directivity<a class="headerlink" href="#directivity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another way in which a finite fault may affect the estimated ground motions is through
directivity. Where a finite fault has been defined in ShakeMap, one may choose to apply
a correction for rupture directivity. We use the approach developed
by <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#rowshandel2010"><span class="std std-ref">Rowshandel (2010)</span></a>
for the NGA GMPEs (note: caution should be exercised when applying this directivity
function to non-NGA GMPEs; in addition, other directivity models give significantly different
results, which is an indication that there is a high degree of uncertainty in these models).
For the purposes of this calculation, we assume a
constant rupture over the fault surface. While the directivity effect is secondary to fault
geometry, it can make a not-insignificant difference in the near-source ground motions
up-rupture or along-strike from the hypocenter.</p>
<p>An example of the effect of the <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#rowshandel2010"><span class="std std-ref">Rowshandel (2010)</span></a> directivity term is shown clearly in
<a class="pageref" href="#figure1-13">Figure  12</a> for a hypothetical strike-slip faulting scenario along the Hayward Fault in the East Bay
area of San Francisco. Unilateral rupture southeastward results in stronger shaking,
particularly along the southern edge of the rupture. The frequency dependence of the
directivity terms provided by <a class="reference internal" href="../manual4_0/sm4_references.html#rowshandel2010"><span class="std std-ref">Rowshandel (2010)</span></a> can be examined in detail by viewing
the intermediate grids produced and stored in the ShakeMap output
directory. In general, longer-period IMs (PGV, PSA1.0 and PSA3.0,
and MMI) are more strongly affected by the directivity function
employed.</p>

the GMPE’s estimates. (See the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#sm35-software-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Software Guide</span></a> for the
specifications of these input
files.) If available, the user should also supply grids of uncertainties for the corresponding
parameters—if not, ShakeMap will use the uncertainties produced by
the GMPE.</p>
<p>User-supplied input motions allow the user to employ more sophisticated numerical ground-motion
modeling techniques, ones that may include, for example, fault-slip distribution and 3D propagation
effects not achievable using empirical GMPEs. The PGM
output grid of such calculations can be rendered with ShakeMap, allowing users to
visualize and employ familiar ShakeMap products. For instance, see the
ShakeCast scenario described in <a class="reference internal" href="shakemap_applications.html#sec-shakemap-applications"><span class="std std-ref">Applications of ShakeMap</span></a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, some of the products of <em>grind</em> are grids of uncertainty for each
parameter. This uncertainty is the result of a weighted average combination of the
uncertainties of the various inputs (observations, converted observations, and estimates)
at each point in the output. These gridded uncertainties are provided in the file
<em>uncertainty.xml</em> (see <a class="reference internal" href="products.html#sec-interpolated-grid-file"><span class="std std-ref">Interpolated Ground Motion Grids</span></a> for a description of the
file format).</p>
<p>Because we also know the GMPE uncertainty over the grid, we can compute the ratio of
the total ShakeMap uncertainty to the GMPE uncertainty. For the purposes of computing
this uncertainty ratio, we use PGA as the reference IM.</p>
<p>Continuing with the Northridge earthquake ShakeMap example, <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-12">Figure  13</a> presents the
uncertainty maps for a variety of constraints.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 13: ShakeMap uncertainty maps for the Northridge earthquake showing
effect of adding a finite fault and strong motion data. Color-coded legend shows uncertainty ratio,
where ‘1.0’ indicates 1.0 times the GMPE’s sigma. A) Hypocenter (black star) only; B) Finite fault
(red rectangle) added but no data (mean uncertainty is 1.00 at all locations since the site-to-source
distance is constrained); C) Hypocenter and strong motion stations (triangles) only (adding stations
reduces overall uncertainty); and D) Finite fault and strong motion stations. Note: Average
uncertainty is computed by averaging uncertainty at grids that lie within the MMI = VI contour
(bold contour line), so panel (D) is marginally higher than (C) despite added constraint (fault model).

<p>For a purely predictive map (of small magnitude), the uncertainty ratio will be 1.0
everywhere. For larger magnitude events, when a finite fault is not available, the
ShakeMap uncertainty is greater than the nominal GMPE uncertainty (as discussed above
in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-median-distance"><span class="std std-ref">Median Distance and Finite Faults</span></a>), leading to a ratio greater than 1.0 in
the near-fault areas and diminishing with distance. When a finite fault is available, the
ratio returns to 1.0. In areas where data are available, the ShakeMap uncertainty is less
than that of the GMPE (see the section “Interpolation,” above), resulting in a ratio less
than 1.0. A grid of the uncertainty ratio (and the PGA uncertainty) is provided in the
output file <em>grid.xml</em> (see <a class="reference internal" href="products.html#sec-interpolated-grid-file"><span class="std std-ref">Interpolated Ground Motion Grids</span></a> for a description of
this file). The uncertainty ratio is the basis for the uncertainty maps and the grading
system described in the <a class="reference internal" href="users_guide.html#users-guide"><span class="std std-ref">User’s Guide</span></a>.</p>
