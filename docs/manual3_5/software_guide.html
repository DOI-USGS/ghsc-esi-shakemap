<p>Installing and operating a ShakeMap system is a non-trivial endeavor. While the software
can be easily obtained, and installed and configured with a few hours work, there are a
great many issues that need to be addressed when an organization considers deploying a
ShakeMap system. In this section, we will discuss a number of these issues.</p>
<div class="section" id="implementation-considerations">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.1. </span>Implementation Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="seismic-network">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.1. </span>Seismic Network<a class="headerlink" href="#seismic-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The single most important prerequisite for operating a ShakeMap system is the existence
of a seismic network capable of determining the location and magnitude of significant
earthquakes within minutes of their occurrence. This network must also produce
parametric data for ShakeMap within minutes of the earthquake. The parametric data
should come from free-field strong motion sensors with real-time or near–real-time
telemetry, and minimally consist of the horizontal components of Peak Ground
Acceleration (PGA) and Peak Ground Velocity (PGV), as well as (ideally) 5% damped pseudo-
spectral acceleration (PSA) at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec periods.</p>
<p>In the absence of such a network, there is little reason to operate ShakeMap locally. The
USGS operates a ShakeMap system that produces maps for significant global
earthquakes within a few minutes of their occurrence, and incorporates any available data
from the Global Seismic Network (GSN), “Did You Feel It?” (DYFI), and any other parametric data to which
we have access. These maps are immediately delivered to the PAGER system and
ShakeCast. It would be far simpler in many cases to obtain the
ShakeMap products from the USGS (through the website or ShakeCast) and use them for
local or regional response and recovery efforts, perhaps even hosting them on local
servers, than to attempt to duplicate our existing system.</p>
<p>Even where a seismic network is operational, it may be preferable to work with the
USGS to produce ShakeMaps. As the following sections will illustrate, running a
ShakeMap system is a considerable operational undertaking, and in many instances it will
strain the resources of local or regional networks. The USGS operates a fully-staffed,
24/7 operations center for global earthquakes and produces ShakeMaps on a daily basis.
If a regional network’s parametric data can be made available to the USGS, the USGS’s
global ShakeMap system will include that data in the processing, and finished ShakeMap
products can be delivered via ShakeCast for local consumption. Please contact us if you
are interested in this kind of arrangement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="seismic-stations-and-parametric-data">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.2. </span>Seismic Stations and Parametric Data<a class="headerlink" href="#seismic-stations-and-parametric-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, seismic waveform or parametric data must be communicated to the
processing center in real-time or near—real–time. The sensors must be “free field” (i.e., not
located in, or adjacent to, large structures) and installed in accordance with modern standard
practices. Strong-motion instruments are preferred for ShakeMap, as broadband
instruments typically clip when ground motions reach the level of interest to ShakeMap.
Co-located strong-motion and broadband instruments can, however, increase the dynamic
range of a station and its overall usefulness, but the network operator is responsible for
specifying the crossover from broadband to strong motion, and ShakeMap should be
presented only with the amplitudes from the favored instrument. Off-scale, clipped,
below-noise, or otherwise unreliable data must be flagged or omitted from the ShakeMap
input files. Horizontal components are mandatory—ShakeMap does not use vertical
components.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the network must produce PGA and PGV for the ShakeMap stations, but
PSA (at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec) is also desirable. The algorithms
used to compute the parametric data should be verified against known standards.
ShakeMap can be quite helpful in
highlighting grossly mis-calibrated stations, but it is best to find these (and more subtle)
errors before a large earthquake strikes.</p>
<p>Intensity data from the USGS’s DYFI system (or an equivalent
regional internet intensity system) is acceptable as input to ShakeMap; however, care
should be exercised with international DYFI data, as it is often aggregated by city and
therefore may be too coarse-grained for large-scale maps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="triggering-shakemap">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.3. </span>Triggering ShakeMap<a class="headerlink" href="#triggering-shakemap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The operator must give careful consideration to the way ShakeMap will be triggered.
Unless an operator is constantly standing by to run ShakeMap, the system must be
automatic to be useful. The operator must select the boundaries of the region ShakeMap
will cover and the minimum earthquake magnitude that will trigger a run. These choices
will be influenced by the reliability of the network’s earthquake location and magnitude
data over the region in question. The operator must also consider that a large earthquake may
occur outside their region of responsibility, but have effects inside their region.</p>
<p>The ShakeMap software is distributed with a program for responding to event triggers
and queuing events to be processed, but it is only applicable to the AQMS network
software. While this software can serve as a guide, users of other systems (e.g., Antelope,
Earthworm) will need to develop their own triggering systems.</p>
<p>Once triggered, ShakeMap will expect to find event and parametric data files in the
event’s input directory. Whether the amplitudes are retrieved from a database or stored in
files, it is the operator’s responsibility to provide ShakeMap with properly formatted
files. Again, example programs are distributed with ShakeMap, but operators should
anticipate that some coding may be necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-configuration">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.4. </span>System Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#system-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While it is relatively easy to install and run the ShakeMap software, a great deal of
consideration is needed to properly configure the system for a particular region.
ShakeMap presents the operator with a large number of configuration options, and these
options will directly affect the accuracy and reliability of the products. The
operator must select the proper GMPE or GMPEs for the region, and specify under which
conditions they will be used. An appropriate Ground-Motion–Intensity Conversion
Equation (GMICE) must likewise be chosen. The operator may also elect to use an Intensity
Prediction Equation (IPE) or to use the default virtual IPE. For best results, the operator
will need to provide a Vs30 grid, and while the <a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/apps/vs30/">USGS’s Vs30 server</a> can supply such a
grid based on topographic slope, a grid based on regional geology is preferable <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1">1</a>. The
user must also decide whether to use GMPE-native or Borcherdt-style site correction
factors. This is just a partial list of configuration choices. There are numerous other
configurable parameters, all of which must be carefully chosen.</p>
<p>While the default ShakeMap webpages are configurable, they are fairly rudimentary and
outdated. In addition, the webpages and ShakeMap products are all in English. Operators
wishing more sophisticated webpages or non-English support can anticipate a substantial
investment in bringing the system online. Some modifications of the ShakeMap software
may be required for languages other than English, but such modifications may make it
more difficult to update the software.</p>
<p>For further information on ShakeMap configuration, see the <a class="reference internal" href="#sm35-software-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Software Guide</span></a> and the
ShakeMap configuration files themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="operations">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.5. </span>Operations<a class="headerlink" href="#operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once an organization begins producing and distributing ShakeMaps, end users will begin
to depend upon them and develop systems that incorporate ShakeMap products into their
response and recovery operations. This means that it essentially becomes mandatory to
produce ShakeMaps following significant earthquakes, and failure to do so is
extremely conspicuous. A robust ShakeMap operation requires the 24/7 availability of
operational personnel. If the facility is not continuously manned, on-call staff must be
designated, and those staff must have the ability to access and operate the ShakeMap
system remotely. Significant earthquakes almost always require some manual
intervention (changing map scale, re-centering, addition of finite fault,
inclusion/exclusion of data, etc.), and experienced personnel are required to evaluate the
situation and perform the necessary tasks.</p>
<p>There are additional, more routine, operational considerations. An experienced
seismologist should routinely review all of the ShakeMaps produced by the system and
take action to correct any deficiencies. A network seismologist should also review the
inputs and outputs of ShakeMap to insure that all stations are producing appropriate data.
A ShakeMap operator should routinely review all ShakeMap processes, logs, databases,
and outputs to insure the system is operating as expected.</p>
<p>The ShakeMap software is usually updated a few times a year. These updates contain
important bug fixes, new functionality, new products, and general improvements. An
operator must review the change logs, decide when to apply the updates, and test the
updated software before it is put into production mode. Occasionally it may be desirable
to rerun earlier events or scenarios to take advantage of the capabilities of the new code.</p>
<p>Hardware and software systems will need to be monitored and maintained for around-the-
clock availability. This includes not just the seismic network and ShakeMap systems, but
also web servers and other network hardware and software required for delivering
products to end users. The personnel responsible for these systems must be on-call and
able to access the necessary systems remotely. Automatic monitoring of mission-critical
hardware and software is strongly encouraged. These systems should also have several
hours of backup power in case of an outage. Periodic outage tests should be
conducted to ensure that all necessary systems remain operational.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, users can be expected to make use of ShakeMaps in a variety of
ways. However, many organizations that could make use of ShakeMap products are
unaware of ShakeMap and the ways it could serve their earthquake response and
recovery needs. We have found that a sustained outreach effort is necessary to maximize
the adoption of ShakeMap and, thus, its value to society. Potential end users include
public utilities, government and private transportation companies, police and fire
departments, regional and national emergency response organizations, private companies
with distributed facilities (e.g., banks, chain stores, telecoms), insurance companies,
investment houses, and many others. Not only can ShakeMap-improved response efforts
benefit post-earthquake recovery, these organizations can provide much-needed support
for network and ShakeMap operations. It is highly recommended that regional networks
considering the implementation of ShakeMap develop a detailed outreach plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scenarios">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.6. </span>Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One important use of ShakeMap is the generation of earthquake scenarios. Scenarios are
predictive maps of the potential shaking resulting from hypothetical future (or past) earthquakes.
Scenarios can be used for planning exercises, public information, or research. Some
users may request specific scenarios, but it is generally worthwhile to develop a suite of
scenarios to cover the likely earthquake hazards of a region. At the USGS, we have begun
using disaggregated hazard maps as the basis for our nationwide scenario project. In other
words, we separate out the individual earthquakes (and causative faults) that together
comprise the hazard in a probabilistic hazard map. The disaggregated maps represent the
best scientific consensus of the probable earthquakes in a region, and should be sufficient
for most uses. Requests for custom scenarios should be carefully evaluated. The
earthquakes represented should be credible in terms of both the causative fault and the
magnitude. In most cases, one of the disaggregated hazard scenarios should suffice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="backup">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.7. </span>Backup<a class="headerlink" href="#backup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Because of the importance of ShakeMap, it is advisable to run redundant systems. Most
ShakeMap operations have a primary and backup machine. The backup machine runs
events as if it were the primary, except it does not transfer its products to the web or other
destinations. If the primary server fails, the backup can be switched over to primary
merely by changing the transfer configuration. This arrangement is also useful when
software updates are available. The update can be applied and tested on the backup
system. Once it is deemed to be operating correctly, it can be made primary, and the
primary server can be updated.</p>
<p>Since most seismic networks are operated from earthquake-prone regions, there is also
the potential that the entire facility will be taken offline. For this reason, it is desirable to
have a backup system operating in a remote location, preferably many kilometers away.</p>
<p>As we have mentioned elsewhere, the USGS makes ShakeMaps for global earthquakes
and provides backup to U.S. regional networks. If you would like to discuss remote
backup for your ShakeMap system, please contact us.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">4.2. </span>ShakeMap Implementation Checklist<a class="headerlink" href="#shakemap-implementation-checklist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The checklist below is based on the one we use when discussing ShakeMap operations with active or
potential producers within the USGS’s Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS).
While some of the issues are ANSS-specific, there may be analogous considerations for
other regional or national networks.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

ShakeMaps for significant events “frozen in time”. Once a ShakeMap gets
used as a reference for damage-loss modelers, insurance investigators, and

available ground-motion data have been collected and included in ShakeMap,
that Version of the map needs to be kept available even if additional updates

<p>ShakeMap requires the freely available PERL, MySQL, and GMT (Generic Mapping Tools),
as well as a few other packages. PERL and GMT are used quite extensively, so any background
with them is advantageous. You will need to assemble the basic GMT-formatted basemaps,
road, city data files, etc., but such data may already be available for your area.</p>
<p>The ShakeMap software is freely available, open-source, and distributed under a Public
