class NewmarkHall1982(IMTConverter):
    """
    Class for conversion between PGA and PSA10 by Newmark and Hall (1982).

    - PSA10 stands for spectral acceleration with oscillator period of 1.0 sec
    - PGV is peak ground velocity.

    The conversion factor is 37.27*2.54.
    Note that 2.54 is the conversion factor to convert from cm/s to in/s and
    37.27 is derived from SA(f) = 1.65*(2*pi*V*f)/386.09, where:

    - SA(f) is spectral acceleration at frequency f (in g)
    - f is the frequency of interest
    - V is the velocity
    - 1.65 is the N&H amplification factor for velocity at 5% damping
    - 386.09 is the acceleration of gravity in inches per second per g

    The sigma factor was computed from an average sigma value determined
    by plotting PGV/PSA10 versus Distance for earthquakes with magnitudes
    greater than or equal to 5.0.
