class VirtualIPE(GMPE):
    """
    Implements a virtual IPE that is the combination of a MultiGMPE
    and a GMICE. Will first attempt to use PGV for the intensities,
    and then will try PGA, and then SA(1.0), and then will bail out.

    Uncertainty is computed by combining the uncertainty of the GMPE
    with the uncertainty of the GMICE. Standard error propagation
    techniques are used (see the ShakeMap manual for a detailed
    explanation). For the intra- and inter-event components of total
    uncertainty, we assign all of GMICE uncertaninty to the intra-event
    term, and none to the inter-event term. This choice is conservative,
    and seems appropriate until GMICE are produced with separate inter-
    and intra-event terms.

    Note that the combined inter- and intra-event uncertainties will
    only approximately equal the total uncertainty because the GMPEs
    will only produce combined uncertainties that are approximately
    equal to their total uncertainty.
