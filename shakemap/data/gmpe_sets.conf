# ##########################################################################
# gmpe_sets: Specify the GMPE sets available to ShakeMap's model module.
# Each sub-section below allows the specification of a set of one or more
# GMPEs to combine together to be treated as a single GMPE by the model
# module. The output of the combined module will be the weighted average 
# combination of the outputs of the individual modules. The parameters
# for each GMPE set are:
#
# - gmpes: A list of one or more GMPE modules. The modules must be the
#          GMPE's short name as defined in modules.conf. If a specified
#          GMPE does not produce the required IMT, then that GMPE is
#          dropped and the weights (see below) of the remaining GMPEs
#          is rebalanced.
# - weights: A list of weights to apply to each of the 'gmpes' specified
#          (in the same order they are specified in the 'gmpes' list).
#          The weights must sum to 1.0.
# - weights_large_distance: A list of weights to apply to the 'gmees' for
#          points at a large distance from the source.
#          See 'dist_cutoff', below. The weights must sum to 1.0. If
#          the list is set to 'None', then 'weights' will be used for
#          all distances.
# - dist_cutoff: A distance (in kilometers) at which the weights of the
#          GMPEs switches from the 'weights" list to the 
#          'weights_large_distance' list. If set to 'nan', then 
#          'weights_large_distance' will not be used.
# - weights_site_gmpes: Provides the weighting of the GMPEs' site 
#          amplification terms applied to the output. This parameter 
#          allows for the inclusion of GMPEs in the gmpes list that
#          do not provide site amplifications or provide inadequate 
#          site amplification terms. The elements of the list must 
#          sum to 1.0. If the list is 'None' then the normal 'weights'
#          are used.
#
# NOTE:
#     - To use a single GMPE, it needs to be defined as a gmpe_set.
#     - Some of the gmpe_sets below for single events were included
#       for migration purposes and have not been tested. It is likely
#       that some will fail, especially for any that don't have a
#       a site term and no site_gmpes have been specified.
