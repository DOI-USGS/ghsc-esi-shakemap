Many contributions in a variety of forms have greatly helped in the development,
implementation, and use of ShakeMap. ShakeMap is just one end
product of a very sophisticated seismic network. Credit is given to all involved
with the regional and national networks in the United States working under the
auspices of the USGS Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS).

Much of the early conceptual development of ShakeMap benefitted greatly from
discussions with Professors Kanamori and Heaton at Caltech. Both the TriNet
Steering and Advisory Committees also provided ongoing oversight and feedback in
the early years of TriNet. Discussions with many colleagues, including Woody
Savage, Ken Campbell, Robert Nigbor, and Mark Petersen, provided additional guidance.
Early trips to the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), and in particular
discussions with Keiji Doi, were also  helpful.

Early ShakeMap webpages survived substantial traffic spikes due to the
ingenuity and vigilance of Stan Schwarz (USGS, Pasadena). Many aesthetic improvements
and integration of the ShakeMap webpages into the USGS Earthquake Hazards Team
webpage standard templates were guided by Lisa Wald (USGS, Golden). Later
implementations were greatly improved by the Haz-Dev Web Team, particularly by
Jeremy Fee and Eric Martinez. They also provide the GeoJSON and other feeds
needed for automatic ShakeMap downloads.

Craig Scrivner, then at the CA Department of Mines & Geology (CDMG),
contributed greatly to the initial ShakeMap software development. Pete
Lombard (U.C. Berkeley) contributed to several important aspects
of ShakeMap code development and Q&A, including developing *plot_regr*.

Global ShakeMap (GSM) is run out of NEIC, Golden, CO, and is operated
primarily by Kuo-Wan Lin, Kristin Marano, Vince Quitoriano, Eric Thompson, 
David Wald, and Bruce Worden.

At regional network centers, Kris Pankow (University of Utah), Steve Malone
(University of Washington), Kuo-Wan Lin (formerly CGS, now USGS, Golden),
Doug Dreger, Pete Lombard (U.C. Berkeley), and Lind Gee (USGS, Menlo Park),
Egill Hauksson (Caltech), Glen Biasi (Univ Nevada, Reno), and
Howard Bundock (ret.), Tim MacDonald, David Oppenheimer, and John Boatwright
(USGS, Menlo Park) all played a critical role in testing, providing
feedback, and improving the ShakeMap system. In addition, a number of other
people assisted the above colleagues in the regional ShakeMap implementation and
operation.

We received extremely important feedback regarding the user interface from
participants through a number of meetings and workshops in CA for
scientific and engineering perspectives, as well as for a very wide variety of
usersâ€™ perspectives. These workshops were organized by Jim Goltz and Margaret
Vinci. In addition, ongoing feedback has always been abundant and provides
critical advice and ideas that seeds ongoing, iterative improvements to the
ShakeMap system.

Over the years, numerous student researchers contributed greatly to the operation,
development, user support and many other aspects of ShakeMap, particularly
developing the ShakeMap Atlas. The students include undergraduates Chloe Gustafson,
Paul Geimer, Alicia Hotovec, Kendra Johnson, Rebecca Johnson, Russell Mah, Tanya Slota;
graduate students Lily Seidman, Sarah Verros, Leslie McWhirter;
and post-doctoral fellows Trevor Allen and Daniel Garcia.

International collaborators include Alberto Michelini, and Licia Faenza (INGV,
Rome) and Carlo Cauzzi (ETH Zurich). ShakeMap Workshops help at U.C. Berkeley
and at the Erice, Sicily Summer School were very helpful in improving ShakeMap
implementations around the country and around the world.

Doug Bausch (formerly FEMA) played a vital role in standardizing HAZUS loss
estimates using ShakeMap input, responding to numerous national earthquake
responses, and promoting the use of ShakeMap among the earthquake
response and planning communities. In interfacing with HAZUS software
and loss estimates, contributions from Jahar Bouabid at
Durham Technology, and Charlie Kircher of Charlie Kircher Assoc. were key.

USGS colleagues Vince Quitoriano and Kuo-Wan Lin have long operated,
supported, and greatly added to the development of ShakeMap. Mike Hearne and
Kristin Marano of the PAGER team have also provided support for ShakeMap. Eric Thompson
has contributed greatly to the development of scenarios and advancing ShakeMap
science. Kishor Jaiswal, Ned Field, Nico Luco, Mark Petersen have all been very helpful
in software calibration and validation and overall advice.

Eric Thompson (USGS, Golden) and Emmette Wald provided helpful rewivews of this Manual.

Lastly, we are also extremely grateful for the recognition of the
importance of ShakeMap and the ongoing internal and external support for its
development at all levels within the USGS. Along the way, the support of
John Filson, David Applegate, Bill Leith, Harley Benz, Cecily Wolfe, Woody Savage, Jill
McCarthy, and many others has been critical.

ShakeMap relies extensively on the Generic Mapping Tools
(:ref:`Wessel and Smith, 1995 <gmt_ref>`).

Thank you all.
