Ground Motion and Intensity Predictions
****************************************

In areas distant from the control of seismic instrumentation or reported intensity, ground 
motions must be estimated using the available earthquake source parameters and GMPEs 
or Intensity Prediction Equations (IPEs). GMPEs are available for a wide range of magnitudes, source mechanisms, 
and tectonic settings. IPEs are still comparatively uncommon, with only a handful of 
published relations, focused on active tectonic and stable shield (cratonic) environments 
(e.g., :ref:`Atkinson and Wald, 2007 <atkinson_wald2007>`; :ref:`Allen et al., 2012 <allen2012>`). To supplement the available IPEs, we 
have developed a "virtual IPE" which is a combination of the operator's selected GMPE 
and Ground Motion/Intensity Conversion Equation (GMICE), which work together to 
present the same interface and behaviors as a direct IPE, while being available for a 
wider range of regional and tectonic environments.

We describe the way ShakeMap employs ground-motion and intensity predictions in 
:ref:`sec_shakemap_processing`. An up-to-date list of the GMPEs and IPEs available for ShakeMap can be 
found in the :ref:`Software Guide <sm35_software_guide>`.
