This ShakeMap Technical Guide is meant as the definitive source of information 
pertaining to the generation of ShakeMaps.  Many of the initial descriptions in :ref:`Wald et al. 
\(1999a\) <wald1999a>` are outdated and are superseded by this current report.  Technical users of 
ShakeMap should also consult the :ref:`users-guide` for additional information 
pertaining to the format and range of available ShakeMap products.

Throughout this document, all parameters are italicized; specific parameters that can be configured within the 
ShakeMap software are indicated in parentheses.  These configurable 
parameters are further described in the ShakeMap :ref:`Software Guide <sm35_software_guide>`.
