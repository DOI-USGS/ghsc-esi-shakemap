ShakeMap originated primarily as an internet-based system to provide
real-time displays of earthquake shaking.
Although the online color-coded intensity maps are the most visible result of
the ShakeMap system and are the most commonly accessed and downloaded
products, they are just one representation of the ShakeMap output. ShakeMap also
produces grids of peak ground acceleration (PGA) and velocity
amplitudes (PGV), peak
spectral response values (PSA), instrumental intensities, seismic station files, fault
files, regression plots, contours, metadata, and uncertainty
estimates. The ShakeMap webpages also serve a variety of formats, including
PDF, KML, XML, GeoJSON, HAZUS-MH, GIS files, ESRI Raster, and a host of other
formats and products for varied user needs and applications.

In this User's Guide, after some background, we present the range of ShakeMap
products and describe the available formats. The different automated mechanisms
to receive and utilize ShakeMap---including GIS Web Services, GeoJSON feeds,
and ShakeCast---are described and links are provided. Many users also
take advantage of real-time ShakeMaps, as well as older events and earthquake
planning scenarios, so we describe the three primary ShakeMap repositories:
real-time ShakeMaps, historic ShakeMap Atlas events, and collections of
Scenario ShakeMaps.

Next is an overview of the current ShakeMap users and applications. Beyond
quickly assessing the overall domain of shaking, ShakeMap is used across many
sectors: planning and response, loss estimation, financial services, education
and outreach, and engineering and seismological research. We provide examples of
each. The section that follows expands on how ShakeMap integrates with the related
systems of DYFI, ShakeCast, and PAGER. Lastly, and importantly, are :ref:`sec_disclaimers`
that users should be aware of and refer to when employing ShakeMap as
part of their post-earthquake decision making.
