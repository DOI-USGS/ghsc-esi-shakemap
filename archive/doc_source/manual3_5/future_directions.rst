Future Directions
####################

ShakeMap is a continual work-in-progress. We note several ongoing developments and "To-Do" lists. Please make suggestions if you would like to weigh in.

Research & Development
---------------------------------
**Feature Requests:**

* Add NGA-West2, NGA-East, and NGA-Subduction GMPEs, including basin terms for NGA-West 2 GMPEs.
* Improved and additional site amplification approaches and tables, in addition to native GMPE (Vs30) site corrections (e.g., :ref:`Seyhan and Stewart, 2014 <seyhan2014>`).
* R&D to improve PGV-to-MMI conversion for large-magnitude and high-velocity ranges. May require switch to converting long-period spectral acceleration
  to MMI. Simulated ground motion time histories may be useful to augment sparse data at high PGV/MMI. 
* Consideration of vector-component IMs, static displacements, and duration-based IMs (Arias Intensity; Cumulative Average Velocity, or CAV) [#f1]_

**In Progress:**

* Spatial variability. Implement optimization methods to compute the spatial correlation field for ShakeMap
  using successive conditional simulations (`Verros et al., 2016) <verros2016>`_.
  Deliver ShakeMap scenarios with multiple realizations of variability.  
* Directivity. Update `Rowshandel (2010) <rowshandel2010>`_ model and implement selected NGA-West2 models.
* Landslide and liquefaction likelihood grid (*sechaz.grid.xml*). Computing probability and distribution of landsliding and liquefaction per
  ShakeMap grid cell. Delivery via Product Distribution Layer (PDL) for ShakeCast, PAGER, and open access.
* Scenario update for all U.S. regions. Delivery to ComCat/Web and allow users a variety of search capabilities (site- or fault-specific).
* Interactive (dynamic) webpages plots (regression, bias, outliers, station amplitudes).
* Improved content and rendering of ShakeMap metadata (*info.xml*; see :ref:`Thompson et al., 2016 <thompson2016>`).  


Software: ShakeMap 4.0 (Python)
-----------------------------------
The release of ShakeMap version 4.0 will represent a significant departure from
previous versions. All of the important computational modules have been
refactored into the Python programming language and make use of the tools in
the widely available Python “scientific distribution”. The core ShakeMap code,
approaching fifteen years old, was due for a major overhaul---to more
organically incorporate the many extensions that had been added over its
lifetime, and to facilitate several new demands from ShakeMap software and
ShakeMap’s expanded role as a global provider of post-earthquake information,
earthquake scenarios, and inputs for loss-modeling software.  

One of the advantages of the rewrite of ShakeMap into the Python language was
the availability of the `GEM OpenQuake <http://www.globalquakemodel.org/openquake/about/>`_
(OQ) library of Ground Motion Prediction
Equations (GMPEs). The OQ hazard library provided us with a broad range of
well-tested, high-performance, open-source GMPEs. Due to constraints imposed by
the software architecture of earlier implementations of ShakeMap, the
development of GMPE modules was time-consuming and difficult, which restricted
the number and timeliness of the available modules. The OQ library provides a
broad array of current GMPE modules, as well as a framework for easily adding
new modules (whether by GEM or ShakeMap staff), jumpstarting our efforts to
re-implement ShakeMap.

The OQ hazard library also provides supporting functions for using the GMPE
modules, including a set of software classes for computing the various distance
measures required by the GMPEs. The ShakeMap fault model, however, was somewhat
more general than allowed for by the OQ planar surface modules, so we
sub-classed the OQ “surface” class and implemented our own fault
module. The open-source, cooperative nature of the OQ project allowed us to
contribute our new module back to the OQ repository, and thus make it available
to other users.

In addition to making use of the GEM OQ library, there are a number of other
advantages to using Python for an application like ShakeMap.  The dynamic
nature of the language means that development time is much reduced, allowing a
small team to generate useful code in a short amount of time.  Also, there is
an active scientific computing Python community that has created many tools
that solve common problems, including an array object for vectorized
operations, input/output routines for common data formats, and plotting/mapping
libraries.  These tools further help to reduce development time and effort.

.. [#f1] We are continuously considering the use of additional ground-motion parameters (IMs)
	 for ShakeMap. However, any such additions cannot be made lightly. In part, this is
	 due to the fact that this requires upgrading process seismic network processing streams
	 that produce parametric and these processes vary significantly among ANSS data sources.
