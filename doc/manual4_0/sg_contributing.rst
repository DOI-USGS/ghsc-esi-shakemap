Guidelines for Contributors
****************************

We encourage contributions to the ShakeMap project. Before
you begin, however, we recommend you contact us (either
directly or, preferrably, through the *issues* feature on
GitHub) to discuss your plans so that we can try to
coordinate activities among contributors and ourselves.

See our LICENSE.md file for details of ShakeMap licensing.
Any contributions will fall under the terms of that license,
and by submitting a pull request you are agreeing to
place your code under our license.
In particular, it is a public domain license, which means
you effectively give up all rights to your contributions,
including to someone who uses or sells the code commercially.

Unit tests are required for all contributed code, and must
provide significant coverage (>90%). All existing tests must
pass or the PR will be rejected.

Documentation is also required. In addition to being 
well-commented, make sure your code has
`Google-style docstrings
<http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_
describe functions and all inputs, 
outputs, and possible exceptions raised. See the section
"Coding Style" below for more.

There is a program, *makedocs.py* at the top level of the
repository. It will rebuild the documentation. It will also
change or create many files. Make sure to run the program 
(and review the documentation) before submitting your pull
request.

See below for details on:

- Development workflow
- Coremods

Coding Style
==========================

We now use the `Black Code Formatter <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ for
all code formatting. You will be expected to run your code through Black
before submitting it to us. There are Black extensions for emacs, vim, 
VSCode, etc. Or you can just run it standalone after you're done editing.

In general, Black follows the `PEP-8 style guide
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. So it's good to follow that
to start with. 

Other things to keep in mind:

**General**

- Document everything with docstrings.
- Comment heavily with useful comments. Useful comments don't say what you
  are doing, they say why you are doing it: ``# Loop over x`` is a useless
  comment, ``# Update the elements of x with our newly-derived coefficients``
  at least tells us something.
- If your changes are extensive or you are adding a significant module,
  talk to us about adding additional documentation to this manual.
- All printed, logged, exception, or otherwise formatted strings are now
  expected to be `f-strings <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html>`_.
  If you don't want to write f-strings, you can always run 
  `flynt <https://pypi.org/project/flynt/>`_ on your finished code to 
  convert. Just remember to run Black afterwards in case flynt breaks any
  rules.

**Names**

Program names should be:

- Lowercase, underscored when necessary
- Without .py suffix (``model``, not ``model.py``)
- Verbs (``model``, not ``modeler``)

Package names should be:

- lowercased, underscored when necessary
- nouns
- reasonably descriptive

Module names should be:

- Lowercased, underscored when necessary
- Nouns
- Reasonably descriptive

Class names should be:

- Camel-cased, starting with uppercase character (``MapCalculator``)
- Nouns

Instance method names should be:

- Camel-cased, starting with lowercase character [calcRxDistance()]
  (Unless superclass uses another style. In that case, follow the 
  superclass style.)
- Verbs
- Reasonably descriptive (``calcDistance`` is ok, does not need to 
  be ``calculateDistance``)
- If not meant to be used by external users, hidden with single 
  or double underscores

Class method names should be:

- Camel-cased, starting with lowercase character (``calcRxDistance``)
- If not meant to be used by external users, hidden with single or 
  double underscores.

Module or program function names should be:

- Lowercased, underscored when necessary
- If not meant to be used by external users, hidden with single or 
  double underscores.

Variable names should be:

- Lowercased, underscored when necessary
- Descriptive when not used as iterators
- Nouns

Global variable/constant names should be:

- Used sparingly, if at all (especially variables)
- ALL_CAPS with underscores if necessary
- Hidden with leading single or double underscores if not meant to 
  be used outside their module (which, really, they shouldn’t be.) 
  The ALL_CAPS convention should be enough to tell people "do not 
  modify this."

Class variable names should be:

- ALL_CAPS with underscores if necessary
- If not meant to be public, probably hidden with single or double 
  underscores and wrapped with getter function (setter functions 
  are probably bad here).  The ALL_CAPS convention should be enough 
  to tell people "do not modify this."

Class instance variable names should be:

- Lowercased, underscored when necessary (fault_distance)
- If meant to be public, probably hidden with single or double 
  underscores and wrapped with getter function (setter functions 
  are probably bad here).
- Possibly hidden with single or double underscores anyway just 
  to keep them private.

**Misc**

- Black will enforce an 88 character line limit when possible
- 4 *space* indentation for code blocks (not tabs)--most Python 
  aware editors should support this out of the box, Black will enforce
- Whitespace and indentation should follow PEP 8 style guide, Black will
  enforce
- Single letter class and function names are discouraged; 
  single-letter variable names should be restricted to things 
  like indices in loops and arrays and should never be "l", 
  "I", or "O" (lowercase L, uppercase i, and uppercase o, 
  respectively). 

**Exception Handling**

- Prefer the built-in Python exceptions where applicable.  The 
  full list is found `here
  <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.IOError>`_, 
  but the exceptions most likely to be used are:

  - KeyError -- Invalid key (as in dict or dict-like object)
  - IndexError -- Invalid index (asking for 11th element of 10 element sequence)
  - TypeError -- Operation or function applied to wrong type.
  - ValueError -- Value out of range (i.e., magnitude > 10)
  - FileNotFoundError -- Kinda self-explanatory

- Regardless of Exception type, use a descriptive error message 
  so the user or developer has a good idea of what exactly the 
  problem was.

**File layout**

- Imports:

  - Stdlib imports first
  - Third-party imports second
  - Local imports last

- All globals should be declared at the top of the file 
  after the imports

- Following the globals, the primary class and/or functions 
  of a module should come first. Secondary and helper classes 
  should follow the primary class. Helper functions and other 
  "invisible" stuff should follow. The ``"__main__"`` block (if 
  any) should come last

**Example**

Below is a simple example module with a module-level method
(``convenience_calculator``) and a class (``DummyClass``)
with a class method (``doThingsWithMagnitude``). For real code
examples, see
`the coremods <https://github.com/usgs/shakemap/tree/master/shakemap/coremods)>`_
directory on Github.

          else:
              calc_result = 0.0
          return calc_result

Workflow
=========

Below is a description of our Git workflow. This workflow
is an adaption of a fairly common set of procedures for working with
GitHub. :numref:`workflow-figure` illustrates the process described
below.

.. _workflow-figure:

.. figure:: _static/workflow.*

   :align: center

   ShakeMap Git workflow.

If they have not previously worked on this project, the developer 
must first fork the main USGS ShakeMap source code repository. This 
fork is 
later called the remote **origin**. The developer then clones the fork 
to the developer’s local development workstation. By cloning from a 
remote repository on GitHub, the local repository automatically sets 
up an origin remote reference. It is a good idea to manually define 
an **upstream** remote reference at this time as well::

  $ git clone git@github.com:username/shakemap.git
  $ cd shakemap
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/usgs/shakemap.git

Working in their local repository, the developer creates a feature 
branch based off the master branch and begins work. Source code is 
modified and incremental commits are made against the local feature 
branch::

  $ git checkout master
  $ git branch branch-name
  $ git checkout branch-name
  $ vim file1 file2 file3
  $ git commit -am 'Modified three files to implement ticket-number.'
  $ vim test1 test2 test3
  $ git commit -am 'Wrote/updated tests for files changed.'

It is important to note that completing the feature involves both 
completing and testing the feature implementation. Having an automated 
test framework helps reduce regression tests moving forward. We use
Travis CI and tests are automatically initiated when a pull request is
made. Unit tests for new code are required or the developer's pull
request will be rejected. Tests and test data are in the *tests* 
sub-directory. Running tests before submitting a pull request is
strongly recommended::

  $ py.test --cov=. --cov-report html

Assuming the tests pass, this command will place a coverage report in
*htmlcov/index.html* that links to the covered files and shows which 
lines are covered and which are not. Please strive for complete 
coverage -- our goal is to keep project coverage above 90 percent.

When the developer completes work for this feature, they first integrate 
any changes contributed by other developers (i.e., changes that were made
to the **upstream** master while they were working on their branch), and then 
push the feature branch 
back to the remote origin. This is done by pulling changes in the **upstream** 
master branch down to the local master, and then rebasing the local feature 
branch against the new local master branch::

  $ git checkout master
  $ git pull --rebase upstream master
  $ git checkout branch-name
  $ git rebase master
  $ git push origin branch-name

Obviously, if there are conflicts while rebasing, the developer must
resolve them before proceeding. Conflicts can be minimized by 
communication with the ShakeMap team through the issues feature of 
GitHub.

The developer now creates a pull request for this feature. This is done by 
logging into their account on GitHub, navigating to their fork of the 
repository, and clicking on the "Pull Request" button on that page. Once
the pull request has been merged by the ShakeMap repositiory admins,
the developer may delete the feature branch on GitHub and their local 
maching. Then, the developer should rebase their master branch from 
the **upstream** master (which now contains their merged feature)
and push them to their **origin** master::

  $ git pull --rebase upstream master
  $ git push origin master

The developer's repository is then ready to begin work on a new
branch.

For the uninitiated this workflow may seem a bit convoluted, but it
has proven to work well for many projects. When in doubt, a good rule
of thumb is: **Never commit to master**. That means that all 
development should take place within feature branches, and the 
local master branch is updated only by pulling from the upstream
repository.

Dependency Management
=====================

A developer may wish to update ShakeMap Python dependencies. For this 
use case, the install script, included in the repository, has arguments 
to assist with this process.

The help for the install.sh script (found at the root level of the ShakeMap
directory) has the following usage help::

  Usage: install.sh [ -u  Update]
                    [ -t  Run tests ]
                    [ -p  Set Python version]
                    [ -n  Don't run tests]

To upgrade to the latest versions of the Python dependencies:

  $ bash install.sh -u

The "-u" option will ignore the platform-specific "spec" file that is 
included in the repository ("deployment_linux.txt" or "deployment_macos.txt") 
and create an environment using the "source_environment.yml" file as input. 
This file may contain some pinning of conda versions in order to avoid conflicts 
between dependencies. 

Running the install script with the update option will force tests to run. 
If all of these tests succeed, then a new "spec" file will be created as 
appropriate to your environment (Linux or MacOS). If ANY of these tests fail,
this file will not be re-created, and the developer should review the code 
being tested to determine if the errors can be resolved by either 1) updating
the code to match changes in dependencies or 2) by pinning the dependencies to
versions that work with the current state of ShakeMap code. Updating the code  
is generally the preferred solution, unless the pinning is to recent versions 
and *higher*. Keeping the ShakeMap code compliant with the most recent versions 
of dependencies will prevent further errors in the future. 

If the developer is working on a Linux platform, they must then have access to a 
MacOS platform, or conversely, a MacOS developer must have access to a Linux platform. 
The developer should run the install script with the "-u" option on *both* platforms, 
and resolve all issues found on both.

If the developer wants to test the installation with a version of Python higher 
than the default version found in the install script ("grep DEFAULT_PYVER install.sh") 
they should use the -p option *together* with the -u option. Given how quickly things 
change in the Python ecosystem, this is likely to cause errors with tests. Resolve in 
the same way as described above.

The install script depends on the following files:
 - source_environment.yml A yaml file with minimal pinning of python dependencies. 
   This file is only ever an input.
 - deployment_linux.txt A text file containing urls of Linux conda packages to download.
   This file is generated by the install script and also used as an input when run with 
   the update option.
 - deployment_macos.txt A text file containing urls of MacOS conda packages to download.
   This file is generated by the install script and also used as an input when run with 
   the update option.
 - requirements.txt A text file with the packages that must be installed by pip instead of conda.

Use cases:
 - "Deployment" Users who simply wish to install ShakeMap in order to run it and have no
   interest in development. These users should run `bash install.sh` to create an environment
   using either the deployment_linux.txt or deployment_macos.txt files as input. To automate
   the running of tests following the install users can run `bash install.sh -t`, otherwise they
   can manually run `py.test --cov=.` after the install is complete.
    
 - "Development" Users who are making routine contributions to the ShakeMap software
   and who do not anticipate adding new dependencies or otherwise changing existing
   dependencies. These users may install much as the "Deployment users, above, with
   the simple `bash install.sh`. The development workflow may then proceed as described
   elsewhere in this document.

 - "Configuration" Users who are contributing to ShakeMap development and need to update
   the ShakeMap code and the Python dependencies. `bash install.sh -u` will update
   dependencies, run tests, and generate a new deployment_<platform>.txt file if the
   tests are successful. If a developer wants to update the environment but NOT run
   tests and NOT generate a new deployment_<platform>.txt file, they can run
   `bash install.sh -un`. Developers who want to update the Python version from the current
   default and the dependencies (many Python packages have version-specific builds) can run
   `bash install.sh -u -p 3.X`. Unless the "-n" option is added, tests will be run and a new 
   deployment_<platform>.txt file will be created. Note that this is a fairly major 
   step and should be taken only in consultation with the ShakeMap development team.

Core Modules
=============

Most developers will be primarily interested in developing modules 
for the ``shake`` program.
The source for these modules may be found in the directory
*shakemap/coremods*. All of the core modules consist of classes that
inherit from the CoreModule abstract class found in *base.py*. When
developing a new module class, the 
developer must set the class variable ``command_name``, and the 
docstring for the new class should specify this command name followed 
by a brief, one-line description of the module's function. The 
developer must then define the ``execute`` function to perform the 
action of the new module. The event ID will be found in
``self._eventid``. The docstring for the ``execute`` module should
be a more substantial explanation of the module's function and outputs
than is found in the class docstring. See the source for *contour.py*
or *info.py* for examples of the way core modules are implemented.

If a module is properly implemented, the ``shake`` program will discover
it automatically and include it in the list of available modules.


Logging
========
Modules should log to ``self.logger``. We encourage logging generally
useful information as ``self.logger.info``, particularly anything that
might normally be put in as a ``print`` statement. We also encourage
logging copious amounts of potentially useful information as
``logger.debug``. Examples include from the ``model`` core module
include:

.. code-block:: python

    self.logger.info('Inside model')
    self.logger.info('%s: nom bias %f nom stddev %f; %d stations (time=%f sec)'
                     % (imtstr, nominal_bias[imtstr], np.sqrt(nom_variance),
                        np.size(sta_lons_rad[imtstr]), bias_time))
    self.logger.debug('\ttime for %s distance=%f' % (imtstr, ddtime))
    self.logger.debug('\ttime for %s correlation=%f' % (imtstr, ctime))
